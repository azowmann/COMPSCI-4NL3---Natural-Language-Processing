                GEORGIA AND AMERICA ARE VALUED PARTNERS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the nation of Georgia and 
America are valued partners. Georgians served with Americans in the 
global war on terrorism. Sadly, Georgia faces a threat to its freedom.
  In October, a scheming dictator, backed by war criminal Putin, the 
Chinese Communist Party, and the Iranian regime, rigged an election.
  Salome Zourabichvili, the legitimate President of Georgia, is 
courageously standing with protesters and peacefully demanding free and 
fair elections.
  I reintroduced the bipartisan MEGOBARI Act to sanction those 
attacking freedom.
  Additionally, there is legislation to prohibit recognizing the 
illegitimate regime.
  I am grateful that at my invitation, President Zourabichvili will 
attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators puts all Americans at risk of 
more 9/11 attacks imminent as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstitute 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Senator Marco Rubio on prevailing at the 
confirmation hearing yesterday I attended, which was so positively 
conducted by Chairman Jim Risch and Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen.
