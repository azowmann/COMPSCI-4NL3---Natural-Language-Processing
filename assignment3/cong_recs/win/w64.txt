                        COMMONSENSE MAGA AGENDA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the FBI defines ``domestic 
terrorism'' as: ``Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/
or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic 
influences . . .''
  America is experiencing an ongoing war, as witnessed in New Orleans, 
in Las Vegas, and a plot to kill in Florida.
  The moral fabric of America has suffered with 4 years of Biden-Harris 
policies, including dangerous open borders, destroyed jobs, crushing 
inflation, campus anti-Semitism, woke mentality, the failure to lead 
globally, and more.
  Unified Republican leadership will advance the conservative agenda to 
make America great again.
  Corrupt Judge Merchan has shamefully revealed Trump derangement by 
scheduling sentencing. This confirms the lawfare backfiring, electing 
Donald Trump, with the corrupt judge receiving my invitation for the 
Trump inauguration, which he unintentionally promoted.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstitute 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.
