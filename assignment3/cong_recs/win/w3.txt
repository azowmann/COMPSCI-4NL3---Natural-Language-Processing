                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  You, O Lord, reign forever judging from Your throne with justice. You 
rule the nations with fairness. On this day, when our Nation's power is 
transferred from President Joseph Biden to President Donald Trump, we 
pray Your reign of peace in this moment, in this Nation, and in the 
hearts of the American people.
  Grant President Biden the blessing of Your reward for his 
faithfulness to You and to this country. And as You lay the mantle of 
responsibility on the shoulders of our new President, Donald Trump, 
grant him, as You did Solomon, a discerning heart to govern Your people 
to distinguish between right and wrong. Grant him the faithfulness of 
Abraham who heard Your voice and obeyed. And may he have the heart of 
David, that You would bestow on him Your grace and mercy as he carries 
out his solemn duties.
  Then bestow on us, divided though we may be, the unity of Your spirit 
through the bond of peace, that we would each commit to live into the 
gifts of that same spirit and to serve one another as faithful stewards 
of Your grace.
  We humble ourselves this day, and we call upon Your name. Hear us 
from Your Heaven, forgive us our sin, and heal our land. God bless 
America.
  Amen.
