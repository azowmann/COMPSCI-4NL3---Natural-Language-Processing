  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week, President 
Donald Trump became the 47th President of the United States. He has 
immediately fulfilled his promises made promises kept on behalf of the 
American people with executive orders restoring common sense.
  Led by the President, Speaker   Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority 
Leader, John Thune, Republicans are delivering an opportunity and a 
freedom agenda by putting America first again by working to cut taxes 
and ensure Americans keep more money in their pockets by creating jobs, 
secure the border to make American families safe again, unleash all-of-
the-above-energy for American energy independence, and to provide for 
peace through strength with the American military.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators puts all Americans at risk of 
more 9/11 attacks imminent as warned by the FBI. Trump is reinstituting 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.
  Americans appreciate the people of Venezuela standing up to the 
Maduro dictatorship.
