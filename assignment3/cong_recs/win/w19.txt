                   RETURNING TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS

  (Mr. STUTZMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly a decade since I had 
the opportunity to address this body.
  In the time I have been gone, Washington has seen a lot of changes. 
Donald Trump was elected two times. Over 200 congressional districts 
have seen new Members take hold. Staffers no longer use BlackBerrys.
  As the old adage goes: The more things change, the more they stay the 
same. Washington's fiscal house is still out of order. Democrats are 
still out of touch with reality, just as we saw on our last vote 20 
minutes ago on the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens 
Act. Conservatism is still in short supply, but Americans recognize 
Washington is broken, which is why they gave our party an irrefutable 
mandate to fix it.
  We must follow the lead of President Trump and Speaker Johnson in 
reducing government overreach and making this country great, healthy, 
and prosperous again.
  The old way of business has doubled our national debt since I was 
last in these Halls and has gradually substituted million-dollar 
spending packages with billion-dollar ones.

  The people have been clear: The Washington of old is out, and 
government for and by the people is in.
