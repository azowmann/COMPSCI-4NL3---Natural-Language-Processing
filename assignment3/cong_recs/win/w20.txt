                EXTREMISTS WHO ATTACKED POLICE OFFICERS

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, Officer Brian Sicknick,
  Officer Howard Liebengood,
  Officer Jeffrey Smith,
  Officer Kyle DeFreytag, and
  Officer Gunther Hashida.
  These are the names of the U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan 
Police who died in the wake of the January 6 Capitol attack.
  Mr. Speaker, 140 police officers were assaulted on January 6, but 
this week Donald Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of over 1,500 
individuals responsible for this attack.
  He has made a mockery of our justice system and the rule of law. 
These were not hostages, and they were not victims. They were 
extremists who showed up armed, wore Nazi symbols, and attacked police 
officers.
  They were militants who planned for months to overthrow the election 
and were convicted of sedition by a jury of their peers.
  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the President has put dangerous 
criminals back on the streets. Today, I echo the National Association 
of Police Organizations in their condemnation of this act.
