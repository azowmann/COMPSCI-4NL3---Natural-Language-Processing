             DISMANTLING OFFICE OF GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION

  (Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, last year, I was so proud to be one of the 
people to help lead an effort to create the first-ever White House 
Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
  Since its establishment in 2023, this office has helped reduce gun 
violence by 20 percent and delivered the lowest violent crime rate in 
over 50 years.
  The office wasn't about politics. It was about saving lives and even 
had bipartisan support from Members in this Chamber.
  On day two of the Trump administration, something happened. That 
progress was recklessly dismantled by President Donald Trump. Just 
today, one day after the office was shut down, students were shot at a 
high school in Nashville, and one was killed.
  While lives are stolen daily by gun violence, this administration is 
busy signing executive orders that have nothing to do with helping 
working families and keeping our communities safe.
  After every mass shooting, the cries of grieving families begged us 
to do something over the last 4 years, and we did, by making this 
office. Here we are again, though, forced to abandon the efforts that 
have saved lives.
  Leaders on both sides of the aisle need to come together to pass 
commonsense gun reform, and we can't stop fighting until we have 
another Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
