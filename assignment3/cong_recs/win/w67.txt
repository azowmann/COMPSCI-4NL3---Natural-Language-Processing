                 U.S.-MOROCCO PARTNERSHIP IS ESSENTIAL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the rule of gun axis of 
invasion continues murderous conduct. Sadly, war criminal Putin, the 
Iranian regime, and the Cuban Communist dictatorship are working to 
destabilize West Africa with the terrorist Polisario Front, a murderous 
threat to the Kingdom of Morocco, an American partner for 250 years.
  Records of the deposed Assad Syrian dictatorship confirm Polisario 
sent militias for training. Last week, the Polisario invited PKK 
terrorists to a summit, threatening our valued NATO ally Turkiye. 
President Donald Trump stood with Morocco, recognizing Western Sahara 
as Moroccan. I appreciate chairing the Morocco Friendship Caucus.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent, as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstitute 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.
  Best wishes to Pete Hegseth. I was grateful to attend the hearing 
where he qualified for Secretary of Defense, ably conducted by Chairman 
Roger Wicker.
