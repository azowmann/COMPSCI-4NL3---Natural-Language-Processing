   PARDONING THOSE WHO ATTACKED OFFICER BRIAN SICKNICK IS DISGRACEFUL

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian 
Sicknick was born in New Brunswick and raised in South River, and he 
died in D.C. on January 7, 2021.
  He succumbed to two successive strokes just hours after being pepper-
sprayed by violent criminals attempting to stop the peaceful transfer 
of power and undo our democracy.
  The men who attacked him just hours before his death, who were 
charged, tried, and convicted of assaulting a police officer, were just 
able to walk free. They were pardoned by Donald Trump.
  Officer Sicknick made the ultimate sacrifice. Pardoning his attackers 
is an assault to his memory, an affront to his family, and a disgrace 
to the Constitution that he swore to uphold and gave his life to 
defend.
  January 6 was a violent insurrection. We have proof. We have videos, 
and nothing will change that history.
