                          DISGRACEFUL RHETORIC

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, unfortunately, to address the 
horrible anti-American comments made by Donald Trump.
  Recently, the prominent Republican posted that it was time to 
terminate the Constitution. The Constitution is the foundation of our 
country and the backbone of our democracy. It is a brilliant document 
that continues to inspire democratic governments worldwide.
  If a Democrat or I had made these comments, the person would be 
widely condemned and denied any attempt to run for office. But the 
Republicans do the opposite. They give weak denunciations of the 
comments--if any at all. But they refuse to reject Trump in public.
  He rejects our institution, fights to deny our elections, and dines 
with racists. Yet, this is the type of person the Republicans believe 
to be a viable candidate for our highest office.
  It is a disgrace and a national embarrassment.
