                         I. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY

    S. 3511, the Satellite Cybersecurity Act, requires the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to 
develop a publicly available online clearinghouse of 
cybersecurity resources, recommendations, and other appropriate 
materials specific to commercial satellite systems (CSS) owners 
and operators, including materials tailored for small 
businesses. The bill also requires CISA to consolidate 
voluntary cybersecurity recommendations, including 
recommendations collected from external sources, such as public 
and private subject matter experts, designed to assist in the 
development, maintenance, and operation of CSS, and for these 
recommendations to be included in the clearinghouse. In 
implementing the bill, the bill also requires CISA to carry out 
the implementation as a public-private partnership to the 
greatest extent practicable, to coordinate with the heads of 
appropriate federal agencies, and to consult with entities 
outside the federal government with expertise in CSS or 
cybersecurity of CSS including private, consensus organizations 
that develop relevant standards.
    Additionally, S. 3511 requires the Comptroller General of 
the United States, in consultation with other federal agencies, 
to study and provide a report to Congress on the effectiveness 
of efforts of the federal government to improve the 
cybersecurity of CSS and any resources made available by 
agencies to support the cybersecurity of CSS. The bill requires 
the report to detail interdependence of critical infrastructure 
and CSS, the extent to which threats to CSS are part of 
critical infrastructure risk analyses and protection plans, the 
extent to which federal agencies rely on CSS, and risks posed 
by foreign ownership or foreign-located CSS physical 
infrastructure.

              II. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION

    CSS are an essential piece of our economy. The Presidential 
Memorandum on Space Policy Directive 5 states that space 
systems are integral to the operation of numerous critical 
infrastructure sectors and functions, including global 
communications; position, navigation, and timing; weather 
monitoring; and ``multiple vital national security 
applications.''\1\ Former Acting CISA Director Brandon Wales 
stated on May 13, 2021 that ``secure and resilient space-based 
assets are critical to our economy, prosperity, and our 
national security.''\2\ The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology also notes that CSS are critical to protect, as 
``[t]he commercial uses of space for research and development, 
material sciences, communication, and sensing are growing in 
size, scale, and importance for the future of the U.S. 
economy.''\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite the critical importance of these systems, 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities in CSS are growing. On November 
20, 2021, Gen. David Thompson of U.S. Space Force stated: ``the 
threats [to satellite systems] are really growing and expanding 
every single day. And it's really an evolution of activity 
that's been happening for a long time.''\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Attacks against CSS have also grown over the recent years. 
Between 2007 and 2008, two American satellites used by the U.S. 
Geological Survey and NASA to monitor climate and terrain were 
compromised multiple times.\5\ In 2014, U.S. officials blamed 
China for a cyberattack that forced the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to cut off public access to 
imagery data from a satellite network used for weather 
forecasting.\6\ Most recently, on February 24, 2022, at the 
onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the KA-SAT 
communication satellite network, owned by the U.S.-based 
company Viasat, Inc., was disrupted and caused communication 
and internet outages within Ukraine, significantly degrading 
Ukrainian defense forces' command and control, and causing 
large scale disruption to a German power company's wind 
turbines.\7\ On March 17, 2022, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and CISA released a joint advisory further 
bringing attention to the cybersecurity threats facing CSS.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While extensive federal and private sector research has led 
to many cybersecurity standards and resources focused on 
traditional enterprise information technology, there is a 
relative lack of easily accessible, consolidated resources 
focused specifically on securing CSS.\9\ The lack of these 
resources is of particular concern given the increase in new 
satellite businesses over the past decade, in part due to the 
drastic decrease in costs to launch satellites.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\Examples of well-established and widely used enterprise 
information technology standards include the National Institute of 
Standard and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Small businesses owning and operating satellites have 
drastically expanded in the past decade as launch prices have 
dropped.\11\ While NASA's Space Shuttle would cost $30,000 per 
pound to put a satellite into low-earth orbit, private 
companies have driven down this cost dramatically and increased 
the frequency of launches.\12\ For example, SpaceX can now 
launch satellites for under $2,000 per pound and Rocket Lab is 
licensed to launch rockets every 72 hours.\13\ Multiple market 
assessments project aggressive growth of the small satellite 
industry over the next decade.\14\ As more businesses enter 
this market, it is critical that these new satellite owners and 
operators are aware of common satellite cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities and the appropriate mitigations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Historic and recent attacks against satellites, and the 
severe consequences of a significant attack against satellite 
systems, makes clear the need for commercial satellite 
cybersecurity. This bill aims to help address this need by 
requiring CISA to consolidate voluntary cybersecurity 
resources, recommendations, and other materials for large and 
small businesses regarding how to secure CSS. To distribute 
these materials efficiently, this bill requires CISA to create 
a clearinghouse, and to curate up-to-date satellite 
cybersecurity information from private industry and federal 
government experts. This bill also requires the Comptroller 
General of the United States to study how the federal 
government supports CSS owners and operators, and the degree to 
which critical infrastructure and the government relies on CSS 
today. The study will also examine how the government uses CSS 
that are owned or operated by foreign entities.
    While historically there has been a lack of federal 
resources dedicated to improving the cybersecurity of CSS, 
CISA's Space Systems Critical Infrastructure Working Group, 
which the agency launched in May 2021, seeks to address this 
risk by working with the private sector in a public-private 
partnership to develop cybersecurity resources for CSS owners 
and operators. This legislation would build upon that work.

                        III. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

    Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) introduced S. 3511, the 
Satellite Cybersecurity Act, on January 13, 2022, with Senator 
John Cornyn (R-TX). The bill was referred to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
    The Committee considered S. 3511 at a business meeting on 
March 30, 2022. During the business meeting, a substitute 
amendment, as modified, was offered by Senator Peters. The 
Peters substitute amendment, as modified, extended the original 
reporting requirement for the study from the Comptroller 
General from one year to two years; refined the Comptroller 
General's agency consultation and coordination requirement; and 
emphasized the use of a public-private partnership in the 
implementation of this act. The Peters substitute amendment, as 
modified, was adopted by voice vote en bloc with Senators 
Peters, Carper, Hassan, Sinema, Rosen, Padilla, Ossoff, Paul, 
Lankford, Romney, Scott, and Hawley present.
    Senator Ossoff offered an amendment which adds additional 
requirements to the Comptroller General study and the 
consolidated recommendations to evaluate the risks associated 
with foreign ownership and foreign location of CSS equipment. 
The Ossoff amendment was adopted by voice vote en bloc with 
Senators Peters, Carper, Hassan, Sinema, Rosen, Padilla, 
Ossoff, Paul, Lankford, Romney, Scott, and Hawley present.
    The Committee ordered the bill, as amended, to be reported 
favorably by voice vote en bloc. Senators present for the vote 
were: Peters, Carper, Hassan, Sinema, Rosen, Padilla, Ossoff, 
Paul, Lankford, Romney, Scott, and Hawley.
    Consistent with Committee Rule 3(G), the Committee reports 
the bill with a technical amendment by mutual agreement of the 
Chairman and Ranking Member.

        IV. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE BILL, AS REPORTED

Section 1. Short title

    This section designates the name of the bill as the 
``Satellite Cybersecurity Act.''

Section 2. Definitions

    This section defines the terms ``commercial satellite 
system,'' critical infrastructure,'' ``cybersecurity risk,'' 
and ``cybersecurity threat.''

Section 3. Report on commercial satellite cyber security

    This section requires a study to be performed by the 
Comptroller General of the United States concerning the 
cybersecurity of commercial satellite systems, including the 
examination of federal government and critical infrastructure 
reliance on these systems, existing government efforts to 
support secure system development and operations, and the 
identification of risks associated with foreign ownership of 
commercial satellite system companies or infrastructure. The 
Comptroller General is required to submit a report to Congress 
no later than two years after enactment of this bill, and 
provide a briefing on the status of the study one year after 
enactment.
    In carrying out this section, GAO is required to coordinate 
with the Department of Homeland Security, Department of 
Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, 
Federal Communications Commission, National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, and the National Executive Committee for 
Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing.

Section 4. Responsibilities of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
        Agency

    Subsection (a) defines the terms ``clearinghouse,'' 
``director,'' and ``small business concern.''
    Subsection (b) establishes the Commercial Satellite 
Cybersecurity Clearinghouse to be developed by the CISA 
Director. The clearinghouse is to be publicly available and 
offer voluntary commercial satellite systems cybersecurity 
resources and recommendations, including materials aimed at 
assisting small business concerns with the development, 
operation, and maintenance of commercial satellite systems.
    Subsection (c) requires the CISA Director to consolidate 
voluntary cybersecurity recommendations for commercial 
satellite systems. The recommendations will address different 
aspects of CSS development and operations, including protection 
against unauthorized access, physical protection measures, 
supply chain risk management, and mitigations against risks 
posed by foreign entity ownership and maintenance of physical 
infrastructure in foreign countries.
    Subsection (d) requires the CISA Director to carry out the 
implementation of this bill as a public-private partnership, to 
the greatest extent practicable. It also requires CISA to 
coordinate with the heads of appropriate federal agencies and 
consult with non-federal entities developing commercial 
satellite systems or supporting the cybersecurity of commercial 
satellite systems, including private, consensus organizations 
that develop relevant standards.

                   V. EVALUATION OF REGULATORY IMPACT

    Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 11(b) of rule 
XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has 
considered the regulatory impact of this bill and determined 
that the bill will have no regulatory impact within the meaning 
of the rules. The Committee agrees with the Congressional 
Budget Office's statement that the bill contains no 
intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs 
on state, local, or tribal governments.

             VI. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, April 19, 2022.
Hon. Gary C. Peters,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. 
        Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 3511, the Satellite 
Cybersecurity Act.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Aldo 
Prosperi.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    	[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    S. 3511 would require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) to disseminate information on cyber 
safety measures to operators of commercial satellites. Under 
the bill, CISA would collect security recommendations from the 
private sector and other federal agencies with expertise in 
satellite operations.
    Using information from CISA about similar information 
sharing efforts, CBO anticipates that the agency would need six 
full-time employees to create and manage an online database 
with cybersecurity resources for satellite operators. CBO 
estimates that staff salaries and technology costs to publish 
safety materials would total $3 million annually. Accounting 
for the time needed to hire new employees and prepare the 
database, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost 
$12 million over the 2022-2026 period; such spending would be 
subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aldo Prosperi. 
The estimate was reviewed by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of Budget 
Analysis.

       VII. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

    This legislation would make no change in existing law, 
within the meaning of clauses (a) and (b) of subparagraph 12 of 
rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, because this 
legislation would not repeal or amend any provision of current 
law.

                                  [all]
