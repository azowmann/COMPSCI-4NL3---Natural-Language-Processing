               OPEN BORDER IS A NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last week, Vice 
President Harris bizarrely said the southern border is secure. The 
reality is more threatening and absurd.
  Since Biden took office, over 3 million illegal aliens have crossed. 
In August alone, there were over 200,000 illegal alien encounters. This 
is three times the illegal crossings compared to

the last August when Donald Trump was President.
  Dangerously, there are 66 trained murderers from the terrorist watch 
list that have crossed. Separately, half a million illegal aliens have 
invaded in the last year, admitted the Department of Homeland Security.
  Biden and the Democrats are responsible for a national security 
crisis due to the open border, with American families at a greater risk 
of murderous attacks than ever before.
  In conclusion, we will not forget 9/11. God bless our troops who 
successfully protected America for 20 years as the global war on 
terrorism continues, moving from a safe haven in Afghanistan to 
America. God bless Ukrainian victory.
