only have dreamed yield back gentlewoman florida mrs murphy mrs murphy article united states constitution establishes electoral college each state's laws provide electors are chosen popular vote december electors met all states district columbia cast their votes joseph biden margin 306 232 election was over biden was president-elect before electoral college met donald trump his allies filed dozens legal challenges election but over over again including front multiple judges president trump had nominated bench many these cases judges were highly critical arguments put forward explaining genuine evidence wide-spread fraud had been presented for example federal judge pennsylvania said t]his court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit speculative accusations unsupported evidence united states america this cannot justify disenfranchisement single voter let alone all voters its sixth most populated state december 15th after electoral college certified outcome republican majority leader senate acknowledged biden's victory senator mcconnell yesterday electors met all states this morning our country has officially president-elect vice president-elect many millions had hoped presidential election would yield different result but our system government has processes determine who will sworn january 20th electoral college has spoken today want congratulate president-elect joe biden mrs murphy even members president trump's cabinet his white house staff understood significance his losses courts absence evidence fraud also respected constitutional certification electoral college many them told president trump was time concede election biden for example then-secretary labor gene scalia accomplished lawyer son late justice scalia called president trump mid-december advised him concede accept rulings courts secretary scalia had put call into president might have called 13th spoke believe 14th which conveyed him thought was time for him acknowledge president biden had prevailed election but communicated president when legal process exhausted when electors have voted that's point which outcome needs expected told him did believe yes once those legal processes were run fraud had not been established had affected outcome election then unfortunately believed what had done was concede outcome mrs murphy have seen prior hearings president trump's justice department his white house staff his campaign officials were repeatedly telling him there was evidence fraud sufficient change outcome election last week conducted 8-hour interview with president trump's white house counsel pat cipollone will see number excerpts interview today even more our next hearing cipollone told agreed with testimony there was evidence fraud sufficient overturn election heaphy want start asking agree cipollone with conclusions matt morgan bill barr all individuals who evaluated those claims there evidence election fraud sufficient undermine outcome any particular state cipollone yes agree with mrs murphy cipollone also specifically testified believed donald trump should have conceded election heaphy did believe cipollone president should concede once made determination based investigations credited--doj did did your mind form belief president should concede election certain point after election cipollone well again was white house counsel some those decisions are political extent that--but--but your question did believe should concede election point time yes did believe leader mcconnell went floor senate believe late december basically said know process done know would line with thinking these things mrs murphy attorney general bill barr testified december 14th should have been end matter attorney general barr december 14th was day states certified their votes sent them congress view was end matter didn't see--you know thought this would lead inexorably new administration mrs murphy cipollone also testified president's chief staff mark meadows said shared this view heaphy early november 23rd meeting understand there was discussion about president possibly conceding election specifically understand mark meadows assured both attorney general barr president would eventually agree graceful exit remember meadows making any such representation cipollone are saying part meeting separately again without--without getting into meeting would say a--that statement sentiment heard from mark meadows heaphy see again know was november 23rd some point cipollone again i--it was probably know around time was probably subsequent time wasn't one-time statement mrs murphy meadows has refused testify committee litigation with him but many other white house officials shared view once litigation ended electoral college met election was over here president trump's former press secretary vice chair cheney wanted clarify mcenany back previous question was your view then--or was your view efforts overturn election should have stopped once litigation was complete mcenany view upon conclusion litigation was when began plan for life after administration mrs murphy this what ivanka trump told heaphy december 14th was day which electoral college met when these electors around country met cast electoral votes consistent with the--the popular vote each state and--and was obviously public proceeding series proceedings president biden had obtained requisite number electors was important day for did affect sort-of your planning your realization whether not there was going end this administration trump think think was my--my sentiment probably prior well mrs murphy judd deere was white house deputy press secretary this was his testimony about what told president trump deere told him personal viewpoint was electoral college had met which system our country is--is set under elect president vice president believed point means for him pursue litigation was probably closed wood recall what his response any was deere disagreed mrs murphy have also seen this testimony from attorney general barr reflecting view white house staff late november attorney general barr then point left walked out oval office jared was there with dan scavino who ran his--ran president's social media who thought was reasonable guy believe reasonable guy said how long is--how long going carry with this stolen election stuff where this going time meadows had caught with and--leaving office caught and--and said that--he said look i--i think he's becoming more realistic knows there's limit how far can take this then jared said know yeah we're working this we're working mrs murphy likewise this testimony cassidy hutchinson aide mark meadows described her conversations with president trump's director national intelligence john ratcliffe former republican congressman hutchinson had expressed was concerned could spiral out control potentially dangerous either for our democracy way things were going for 6th mrs murphy course underlying all this fundamental principle president united states cannot simply disregard rulings state federal courts which are empowered address specific election related claims president cannot simply pretend courts had not ruled vice chair cheney time president his associates had brought--had out cases had brought challenge different aspects election number states out those cases time get january 3rd that's--that's been clear assume pat would agree president is--is obligated abide rulings courts cipollone course vice chair cheney assume also cipollone everybody obligated abide rulings courts vice chair cheney assume also would agree president has particular obligation take care laws faithfully executed cipollone one president's obligations correct mrs murphy yet president trump disregarded these court rulings counsel from his closest advisors continued his efforts cling power our prior hearings have heard considerable testimony about president trump's attempts corruptly pressure vice president pence refuse count electoral votes corrupt department justice pressure state officials state legislatures create submit series fake electoral slates now will show what other actions president trump was taking between december january 6th yield gentleman from maryland raskin raskin thank mrs murphy throughout our hearings have heard how president trump made baseless claims voting machines were being manipulated foreign powers election have also heard trump's attorney general bill barr describe such claims complete nonsense which told president let's review testimony attorney general barr saw absolutely zero basis for allegations but were made such sensational way obviously were influencing lot people--members public--that there was this systemic corruption system their votes didn't count these machines controlled somebody else were actually determining which was complete nonsense was being laid out there told them was--it was crazy stuff were wasting their time was doing great grave disservice country raskin have learned president trump's white house counsel agreed with department justice about this heaphy attorney general barr made public announcement december 1st less than month after election had seen systemic fraud sufficient undermine outcome election fair say december 1st had reached same conclusion cipollone it's fair say agreed with attorney general's--attorney general barr's conclusion december 1st yes did supported conclusion raskin however strong rejection attorney general white house counsel these claims did not stop president from trying press them public but not all did indeed will see this clip president asked attorney general bill barr have department justice seize voting machines states attorney general barr recollection president said something like well could get bottom--you know some people say could get bottom this if--if department seizes machines was typical way raising point said absolutely not there's probable cause i'm not going seize any machines was heaphy yeah raskin but this wasn't end matter evening december sidney powell general michael flynn others entered white house for unplanned meeting with president--the meeting would last multiple hours become hot-blooded contentious executive order behind screen was drafted december 16th just days after electoral college vote several president's outside advisors over luncheon trump international hotel can see here this proposed order directs secretary defense seize voting machines effective immediately but goes even further than under order president trump would appoint special counsel with power seize machines then charge people with crimes with all resources necessary carry out her duties specific plan was name sidney powell special counsel trump lawyer who had spent post-election period making outlandish claims about venezuelan chinese interference election among others here what white house counsel pat cipollone had say about sidney powell's qualifications take such expansive authority cipollone don't think sidney--sidney powell would say thought was good idea appoint her special counsel was vehemently opposed--i didn't think should have been appointed anything raskin sidney powell told president these steps were justified because her evidence foreign interference election however have seen trump's allies had such evidence course legal authority for federal government seize state voting machines here cipollone again denouncing sidney powell's terrible idea cipollone there was real question mind real concern know particularly after attorney general had reached conclusion there wasn't sufficient election fraud change outcome election when other people kept suggesting there was answer what some point have put shut was view heaphy why was this broader scale bad idea for country cipollone have federal government seize voting machines that's terrible idea for country that's not how things united states there's legal authority there way contest elections know that--that happens all time but idea federal government could come seize election machines that--that's--i don't--i don't understand why even have tell why that's bad idea for country it's terrible idea raskin for all its absurdity december 18th meeting was critically important because president trump got watch close for several hours his white house counsel other white house lawyers destroyed baseless factual claims ridiculous legal arguments being offered sidney powell mike flynn others president trump now knew all these claims were nonsense not just from his able white house lawyers but also from his own department justice officials indeed his own campaign officials white house counsel cipollone told cipollone with respect whole election fraud issue sort you're going make those kind claims--and people were open them early because people were making all sorts claims real question show evidence okay raskin wasn't just justice department trump campaign trump white house lawyers who knew even rudy giuliani's own legal team admitted did not have any real evidence fraud sufficient change election result here email from rudy giuliani's lead investigator bernie kerik december chief staff mark meadows kerik did not mince any words can all investigations want later but president plans winning it's legislators have moved this will just kerik wanted president what didn't say this email was what would later tell select committee letter his lawyer wrote november letter said was impossible for kerik his team determine conclusively whether there was wide-spread fraud whether wide-spread fraud would have altered outcome election other words even rudy giuliani's own legal team knew before january 6th hadn't collected enough actual evidence support any their stolen election claims here what trump campaign senior advisor jason miller told committee about some so-called evidence fraud campaign had seen from giuliani team george know what examples fraud--numbers names supporting evidence--was sent brooks's office when say mean campaign jason miller there are some very very general documents far as--as far say for example here are handful dead people several different states here are explanations couple legal challenges far saying the--the rules were changed unconstitutional manner but was--to say was spin is--is probably understatement raskin here how president trump's deputy campaign manager described evidence fraud campaign had seen lucier never came learn understand mayor giuliani had--had produced evidence election fraud fair justin clark that's fair raskin here testimony received from speaker arizona house representatives rusty bowers about exchange had with rudy giuliani after election schiff some point did one them make comment didn't have evidence but had lot theories bowers was giuliani raskin chief staff mark meadows told people thought trump should concede around time electoral college certified result but nonetheless later worked try facilitate president trump's wishes here what cassidy hutchinson told hutchinson during this period he--i perceived his goal with all this keep trump office know had very seriously deeply considered allegations voter fraud but when began acknowledging maybe there wasn't enough voter fraud overturn election know i--i witnessed him start explore potential constitutional loopholes more extensively which then connected with john eastman's theories raskin startling conclusion this even agreed-upon complete lack evidence could not stop president trump mark meadows their allies from trying overturn results free fair election let's return meeting white house evening december 18th night group showed white house including sidney powell retired lieutenant general michael flynn former overstock.com ceo patrick byrne after gaining access building from junior white house staffer group made their way oval office were able speak with president himself for some time until white house officials learned meeting what ensued was heated profane clash between this group president trump's white house advisors who traded personal insults accusations disloyalty president even challenges physically fight meeting would last over hours beginning here oval office moving around west wing many hours later ending president's private residence select committee has spoken with six participants well staffers who could hear screaming from outside oval office what took place next best told their own words will see from this video harris did believe was going work were going able get see president without appointment powell had idea harris fact did get see president without appointment powell did harris how much time did have alone with president say alone had other people with powell right harris continuing but think from his aides before crowd came running powell probably more than minutes harris was powell continuing bet pat cipollone set new land speed record cipollone got call either from molly from eric herschmann needed get oval office hutchinson was first point had recognized okay there nobody there from white house mark's gone what's going right now cipollone opened door walked saw general flynn saw sidney powell sitting there was not happy see people who were oval office heaphy explain why cipollone well again i--i don't think were providing well first all overstock person i--i've never met--never never knew who this guy was actually first thing did walked looked him said who are told don't think--i don't think any these people were providing president with good advice i--i--i didn't understand how had gotten harris short period time had with president did seem receptive presentation were making powell was very interested hearing particularly about cisa findings terms 13848 apparently nobody else had bothered inform him herschmann was asking like are you're claiming democrats were working with hugo chavez venezuelans whomever else one point general flynn took out diagram supposedly showed addresses all over world and--or isp--who was--who was communicating with whom via machines some comment about like nest thermostats being hooked internet george it's been reported during this meeting powell talked about dominion voting machines made various election fraud claims involve foreign countries such venezuela iran china accurate general flynn fifth george was meeting tense lyons yeah i--it was not casual meeting george explain lyons mean times there were people shouting each other hurling insults each other wasn't just sort people sitting around couch like chit-chatting lucier recall whether raised powell fact campaign had all cases had brought litigation cipollone yes raised lucier what was response cipollone don't remember what said don't think was good response powell cipollone herschmann whoever other guy was showed nothing but contempt disdain president cipollone remember three them were really sort-of forcefully attacking verbally eric derek were pushing back were asking one simple question a--as general matter where evidence heaphy what response did get when asked powell her colleagues where's evidence cipollone variety responses based current recollection including know can't believe would say something like know things like this like what mean where's evidence should know yeah i--things like know disregard would say general disregard for importance actually backing what say with facts lyons know then there was discussion well know don't have now but will have whatever powell mean if--if had been sitting his chair would have fired all night had escorted out building herschmann which derek both challenged what was saying says well judges are corrupt was like every one every single case you've done country guys every one them corrupt even ones appointed inaudible i'm being nice was much more harsh her apecechea one other things that's been reported was said during this meeting was president trump told white house lawyers herschmann cipollone weren't offering him any solutions but powell others were why not try what powell others were proposing remember anything along those lines being said president trump lyons sounds right herschmann think got point where screaming was completely completely out there mean had people walk was late night had been long day what were proposing thought was nuts giuliani i'm gonna--i'm gonna categorically describe guys are not tough enough maybe put another way you're bunch pussies excuse expression but that--that's i--i'm almost certain word was used herschmann flynn screamed was quitter everything kept standing turning around screaming certain point had with him yelled back better come over better sit your f'ing ass back down giuliani president white house team went upstairs residence but public part residence know big--the big parlor where can have meetings conference room harris yellow oval call yellow oval giuliani yes exactly yellow oval office always called upper i'm not exactly sure where sidney group went think maybe roosevelt room stayed cabinet room which kind cool really liked all my--all myself lyons end day landed where started meeting least from structural standpoint which was sidney powell was fighting mike flynn was fighting were looking for avenues would enable--that would result president trump remaining president trump for second term raskin meeting finally ended after midnight here are text messages sent cassidy hutchinson during after meeting can see hutchinson reported meeting west wing was unhinged meeting finally broke after midnight during early morning december 19th cassidy hutchinson captured moment mark meadows escorting rudy giuliani off white house grounds make sure didn't wander back mansion certain accounts this meeting indicate president trump actually granted powell security clearance appointed her somewhat-ill-defined position special counsel powell asked pat cipollone had authority name special counsel said yes then asked him had authority give whatever security clearance needed pat cipollone said yes then president said okay know i'm naming her i'm giving her security clearance then shortly before left totally blew that's when cipollone and/or herschmann whoever other young man was said can name her whatever want name her one's going pay any attention harris how did respond how did president respond powell something like see what deal with deal with this all time raskin over ensuing days further steps were taken appoint sidney powell but there some ambiguity about what president actually said did during meeting here how pat cipollone described cipollone don't know what her understanding whether had been appointed what had been appointed okay view hadn't been appointed anything ultimately wasn't appointed anything because there had other steps taken was view when left meeting but may have different view others may have different view and--and president may have different view vice chair cheney were any steps taken including president himself telling her she'd been appointed cipollone again i'm not going get into what president said meeting know recollection you're not appointed even--you're not appointed until--until steps are taken get paperwork done get--and when left meeting okay--i guess--i guess what i'm trying say i'm not going get into what president said want--said wanted raskin cipollone when matter continued flare over next several days was your understanding sidney powell was still seeking appointment was asserting had been appointed president december 18th meeting cipollone know now mention probably both know in--in terms like think was--i think may have been view had been appointed was seeking know get--get done and--and--and should appointed raskin listen these clips remember powell person who president trump tried make special counsel was ultimately sanctioned federal court sued dominion voting systems for defamation her own defense lawsuit sidney powell argued reasonable person would conclude statements were truly statements fact not long after sidney powell general flynn rudy giuliani left white house early hours morning president trump turned away from both his outside advisors most outlandish unworkable schemes his white house counsel's advice swallow hard accept reality

subject line white house meeting december 21st regarding january 6th his email congressman brooks explained had not asked anyone join him january 6th effort because his view only citizens can exert necessary influence senators congressmen join this fight against massive voter fraud election theft this point may also recall testimony given our earlier hearing acting deputy attorney general richard donoghue who said president asked department justice just say election was corrupt leave rest republican congressmen according white house visitor logs obtained committee members congress present white house december 21st included congressmen brian babin andy biggs matt gaetz louie gohmert paul gosar andy harris jody hice jim jordan scott perry then-congresswoman-elect marjorie taylor greene was also there heard testimony early hearing pardon was ultimately requested congressman brooks other members congress who attended this meeting have asked witnesses what happened during december 21st meeting have learned part discussion centered role vice president during counting electoral votes these members congress were discussing what would later known eastman theory which was being pushed attorney john eastman one our earlier hearings heard great detail president trump was trying convince vice president pence something illegal his white house counsel confirmed all testimony last week heaphy tell your view cipollone upon those discussions with philbin with greg jacob what was your assessment what vice president could could not joint session cipollone what was assessment heaphy yes cipollone continuing about what could couldn't heaphy yes your view issue cipollone view was vice president didn't have legal authority anything except what did heaphy have both told philbin jacob looked very closely eastman memos eastman theory thought had basis was not strategy president should pursue sounds like that's consistent with your impression well cipollone impression would've been informed certainly them mrs murphy campaign senior advisor jason miller told cipollone thought john eastman's theories were nutty something cipollone wouldn't refute heaphy we've received testimony from various people about this one was jason miller who was campaign said way was communicated was pat cipollone thought idea was nutty one point confronted eastman basically with same sentiment cipollone don't have any reason contradict what said mrs murphy january 4th john eastman went white house meet with president vice president cipollone tried participate this meeting but was apparently turned away heaphy didn't meeting oval office where eastman met with president vice president remember why didn't personally attend cipollone did walk meeting did into oval office with idea attending meeting then ultimately did not attend meeting heaphy why not cipollone reasons for are privileged heaphy okay were asked not attend meeting did make personal decision not attend meeting cipollone again without getting into purpura privilege mrs murphy recall greg jacob vice president's counsel stated eastman acknowledged would his legal theory were challenged supreme court cipollone had reviewed eastman's legal theory expressed his view repeatedly vice president was right even offered take blame for vice president's position cipollone thought vice president did not have authority what was being suggested under proper reading law conveyed okay think had actually told somebody know vice president's--just blame i'm not politician know just said i'm lawyer this legal opinion but let tell this can say word about vice president heaphy please cipollone think vice president did right thing think did courageous thing have great deal respect for vice president pence worked with him very closely think understood opinion think understood opinion afterwards well think did great service this country think suggested somebody should given presidential medal freedom for his actions mrs murphy earlier this year federal district court judge concluded president trump eastman relying eastman's theory more likely than not violated multiple federal criminal laws their pressure campaign against vice president also recall earlier this hearing saw rudy giuliani's team did not have actual evidence fraud sufficient change result election important because january 6th approached republican members house senate were looking for reason object electors real evidence was ever given them know republican members house received memorandum from chairwoman house

how show fidelity constitution run-up january 6th donald trump had obligation tell his supporters accept results election instead urged them further along path toward mob violence idea mob violence makes think another sort fail-safe all across this country there are different ideas about what role federal government should play our lives fact here this dais there are plenty different ideas but there are moments when institutions our federal government are fail-safe from part country where had not been for federal government constitution parents many more americans like them would have continued treated second-class citizens freedom able vote without harassment travel relative safety dine sleep where choose because have government looks over well-being its citizens this especially important moments crisis when have natural disaster state governments can't handle their own when there emergency requires action our public health services our military have federal government what happened january 2021 was another one those moments history tests strength our federal government january 6th was attack our country was attack our democracy our constitution sitting president with violent mob trying stop peaceful transfer power from one president another still makes blood boil think moment like what would expect see expect see president united states sitting behind resolute desk oval office assuring american people attack would repelled threat would dealt with would expect reassured there was fail-safe instead president united states sent mob disregarded advice people who had taken oath constitution oversaw scheme aided people whose loyalty was only donald trump there nothing could compare there nothing our great nation's history has ever come close sort betrayal dereliction thank goodness our system government held spite commander-in-chief who worked opposition what constitution designed when this committee reconvenes will tell story supreme dereliction commander-in-chief how close came catastrophe for our democracy how remain serious danger chair requests those hearing room remain seated until capitol police have escorted witnesses members from room without objection committee stands adjourned whereupon 3:57 p.m committee was adjourned prepared statement jason van tatenhove former national media director for oath keepers july 2022 name jason van tatenhove journalist author living colorado here giving testimony select committee investigate january 6th attack united states capitol because for short period had access inside view both inner workings oath keepers its founder president stewart rhodes from beginning knew this would story world would someday need hear deeply saddened how correct this intuition was come from family artists writers have always worked some way artist journalist local colorado where have written for several outlets northern colorado important for here today front select committee because all americans need pay attention genuine danger extremist groups like oath keepers pose our society because actions taken january 6th increased political ideological polarization our society fear what next election cycle will bring need re-learn how communicate with one another without guns body armor standoffs trying make amends for what did during time with oath keepers because remorseful for helping them push their dangerous propaganda light select committee's work truth have uncovered optimistic this experience voice can help shed light these issues embolden others walk away from extremist groups like oath keepers want note outset first-hand knowledge oath keepers stopped when resigned will describe but given insider access close proximity stewart rhodes--including during several months when lived basement--i can help paint picture oath keepers how worked how operated how dangerous are not know about planning execution events surrounding what happened capitol january 6th 2021 still from experience with ever-radicalizing organization know troubling signs were there years before journey with oath keepers began during 2014 bundy ranch standoff was embedded with stewart rhodes his vehicle made his second trip down standoff desert nevada was given unprecedented access stewart rhodes oath keepers including organization's inner workings this access continued covered subsequent two standoffs sugar pine mine standoff white hope mine standoff this culminated job offer with oath keepers after name was included press release group which led resignation from working for state montana was offered job national media director webpage associate editor for organization worked closely with stewart rhodes for next year half often traveled with him various events throughout united states during this period saw stewart rhodes courting members alt-right having issues with this radicalization knew had make break with group even would financially devastating family there came point when walked conversation local grocery store where long-standing influential oath keeper members associates were discussing their thoughts openly denying holocaust had ever actually happened moment decided matter what would need break ties with this ever radicalizing group not racist not anti-semite not white supremacist not violent could longer associated with oath keepers whatever consequences might have been now view obligation sound alarm raise public awareness about oath keepers get perspective this paramilitary group into public conversation while this may come surprise some many true motivations this group revolve around raising funds not propaganda push stewart rhodes oath keepers insert themselves into crises situations would not usually have any part seek make themselves relevant fundraise back these conflicts increase membership rolls recruitment crucial focus for oath keepers target demographic people feel marginalized have seen these individuals whipped into dangerous action group's leadership just saw january 6th this combined with catering conspiracy theories day attempt connect with ever-radicalizing communities within alt-right white nationalists even outright racists gain more influence money dangerous proposition for our country cannot allow these groups continue threatening our democracy must focus understanding this reality most importantly combating them there have been times when have personally discounted reach this group its violent messaging this was mistake because end were able muster group heavily armed outfitted members who had been trained modern warfare techniques including those now know had explosives storm capitol stop process inaugurating duly elected president have been exceedingly lucky have not seen much more bloodshed but luck not good strategy for country looking for better ways move forward time speak truth about these groups violent influence wield time show exit ramp others like who may have been caught rhetoric these groups used pawns dishonest campaign capture more money influence power have been frightened what saw when was associated with oath keepers even more what saw january 6th honored provide perspective select committee american people congressional record volume 168 number thursday january 2022 senate pages s195-s197 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov voting rights schumer madam president defending democracy--something leader reid would have been passionate about were still with here telling now--over next few days u.s senate will face critical unavoidable question are its members going act protect our democracy protect voting rights will its members choose path obstruction inaction side with big lie overtaking our precious experiment self-rule had two professors come days ago authors how democracies die one main ways democracies die when one political party refuses accept results election was run freely fairly what happening here showed how important this how there unfortunate historical precedent doing what did earlier this week president biden made clear made clear nation--and all who serve senate--that time answer question about whether allowing big lie ruinous democracy overtake our precious experiment self-rule will prevail senate has done many times its history must soon act again safeguard democracy from dangers present day power dark money voter suppression efforts subvert democratic process from bottom commend president biden for offering strong speech look forward having him join senate democrats later today our caucus meeting discuss path forward yesterday shared with democratic colleagues our plan for what next few days are going look like this chamber how majority leader will move finally begin last floor debate voting rights legislation later today house representatives will pass message will include language two bills republicans have filibustered for months--the freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act permitted under existing rules will have ability proceed legislation debate simple majority basis something has been denied four times last several months because republicans didn't want move forward then senate will finally hold debate voting rights legislation for first time this congress every senator will faced with choice whether not pass this legislation protect our democracy there has been lot gas-lighting here floor lately from other side about power grabs about takeovers but precious little terms substance have not heard them mention what republican legislatures are page s196 doing not thrust their speech say power grab takeover well friends there was ever power grab what happening state legislatures right now where republican legislators are taking away people's sacred right vote aiming particularly certain groups--people color young people people urban areas older people disabled people let remind colleagues what these bills actually freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act are balanced effective commonsense bills build work this chamber has done past protect democracy was often done with bipartisan votes transformation republican party era donald trump apparent nasty most importantly really dangerous our democracy these laws set basic standards for all american citizens vote safely vote securely while protecting elections from attempts subversion what wrong with how power grab allow people vote people who should have power not politicians state legislative bodies take away bill also fights against power big money has cascaded into our system much now being used try intimidate legislators senators congressmen from preserving this right vote bill ends partisan gerrymandering have all seen situations--the legislature wisconsin state assembly where percent people voted for democratic legislators but only about third seats are democratic due severe nature this gerrymandering importantly these bills restore critical preclearance provisions were once part voting rights act many republican colleagues supported past which conservative majority supreme court shamefully gutted roughly decade ago democrats have tried for months--months--to convince our republican colleagues join bipartisan basis begin debate these bills avail presented these reasonable commonsense proposals said many which had been voted republicans past presented them floor june august october november each time promised republican colleagues would have opportunity voice their concerns offer germane amendments wouldn't limit germane amendments wished offer have lobbied republicans privately tried engage them both senate rules committee senate judiciary committee every step way--every step way--we have been met with near total resistance date none our efforts have produced any meaningful engagement from other side aisle but members this chamber were elected debate vote particularly issue vital beating heart our democracy this have said for months just because republicans have refused work with protect voting rights does not mean democrats would stop working move forward our own matter simply too important wellspring our democracy right which all other rights are secured--voting reading biography grant chernow thing southern segregationists who happened democrats time wanted take away from newly freed slaves was right vote knew black people didn't have right vote south would have power--no power over our laws power where resources power decide directions country was thing wanted prevent vital keep people's right vote particularly when some laws--too many--are aimed people color reminding racism poison america still will move forward path have laid out sets process which senators can finally make clear american people where stand protecting our democracy republicans will have chance show where stand preserving right every eligible citizen cast ballot republicans will have chance make clear where stand fighting efforts empower partisan actors subvert election process create more big lies future republicans will have chance make clear where stand fighting power dark money which many americans oppose--democrats republicans republicans will have chance show where stand ending partisan gerrymandering course ultimately end debate pass anything will also need republicans join ultimately cloture don't will left with choice but consider changes senate rules can move forward changing senate rules has been done many times before this chamber this not first second third time this happening all must make choice about whether not will our part preserve our democratic republic this day age cannot satisfied thinking democracy will out end are not willing put work strength courage defend last night read op-ed published president obama eloquently laid out what really stake here encourage colleagues read haven't already reminded democracy not given not self-executing but can indeed survive thrive are prepared follow footsteps great americans who did their part defend democracy before many them giving their lives are now being called upon our part madam president now ask unanimous consent have printed record obama op-ed which will bring desk shortly there being objection material was ordered printed record follows jan 2022 former president obama usa today need follow john lewis example fight for our democracy former president barack obama world future generations will watching obama writes calls senate right thing pass legislation protect voting rights when spoke john lewis memorial service two years ago emphasized truth john knew better than just about anyone our democracy isn't given isn't self-executing citizens have nurture tend have work task have vigilantly preserve protect our most basic tool self-government which right vote time various state legislators across country had already passed variety laws designed make voting harder was attack everything john lewis fought for challenge our most fundamental democratic freedoms since then things have only gotten worse slow unraveling basic democratic principles while american people turned out vote highest rate century last presidential election members one our two major political parties--spurred then-sitting president--denied results election spun conspiracy theories drove violent mob attack our capitol protesters attack capitol jan although initially rejected many republicans those claims continued amplified conservative media outlets have since been embraced sizable portion republican voters--not mention gop elected officials who least should know better those republican officials conservative thought leaders who have courageously stood their ground rejected such anti democratic efforts have found themselves ostracized threatened subjected primary challenges meanwhile state legislators states have introduced more than 400 bills designed suppress votes some these bills we've seen before legislation would discourage voters including racial minorities low-income voters young people from casting ballot others aim treat certain polling locations differently creating one set rules for voters living cities another set for people living more conservative rural areas we're also seeing more aggressive attempts gerrymander congressional districts gerrymandering which essentially allows politicians choose their voters instead other way around isn't new--and both parties have engaged but what we're seeing now are far more aggressive precise efforts part republican state legislatures tilt playing page s197 field their favor states have approved new congressional maps there are now fewer competitive districts than there were before fewer competitive districts increases partisanship since candidates who only have appeal primary voters have incentive compromise move center finally perhaps most perniciously we've seen state legislatures try assert power over core election processes including ability certify election results these partisan attempts voter nullification are unlike anything we've seen modern times represent profound threat basic democratic principle all votes should counted fairly objectively good news majority american voters are resistant this slow unraveling basic democratic institutions electoral mechanisms but their elected representatives have sacred obligation push back well--and now time now there are bills front senate would protect right vote end partisan gerrymandering restore crucial parts voting rights act bill sponsors have diligently reached out their republican colleagues obtain their support sadly almost every senate republican who expressed concern about threats our democracy immediate aftermath jan insurrection has since been cowed into silence reversed their positions when one bills front senate today was introduced november every democrat supported every republican but one voted against moving forward protecting our democracy wasn't always partisan issue voting rights act was result democratic republican efforts both president reagan president george bush signed its renewal when were office but even senate republicans now refuse stand for our democracy democrats should able get job done with simple majority vote there are already senators who support bills safeguard elections only thing standing way filibuster--a senate procedure allows minority just senators prevent legislation from being brought for vote filibuster has basis constitution historically parliamentary tactic was used sparingly most notably southern senators block civil rights legislation prop jim crow recent years filibuster became routine way for senate minority block important progress issues supported majority voters but can't allow used block efforts protect our democracy that's why fully support president joe biden's call modify senate rules necessary make sure pending voting rights legislation gets called for vote every american who cares about survival our most cherished institutions should support president's call well protecting our democratic institutions for generations americans every political stripe have taken pride our status world's oldest continuous democracy have spilled precious blood spent countless treasure defense democracy freedom abroad but learned during jim crow era our role democracy's defender isn't credible when violate rights freedoms our own citizens time when democracy under attack every continent can't hope set example for world when one our two major parties seems intent chipping away foundation our own democracy single piece legislation can guarantee we'll make progress every challenge face nation but legislation ensures right vote makes sure every vote properly counted will give better chance meeting those challenges it's how can overcome gridlock cynicism that's prevalent right now it's how can stop climate change reform our broken immigration system help ensure our children enjoy economy works for everyone not just few now time for all follow john lewis example now time for u.s senate right thing america's long-standing grand experiment democracy being sorely tested future generations are counting meet test schumer finally continue this important conversation about future our democracy ask democratic colleagues consider following right vote cornerstone our democracy then how can good conscience allow for situation which republican party can debate pass voter suppression laws state level with only simple majority vote but not allow united states same let repeat right vote cornerstone our democracy then how can good conscience allow for situation which republican party can debate

votes state state for most part candidates who popular vote state wins all state's electoral college votes whoever wins majority electoral college votes wins presidency when donald trump tried overturn election results focused just few states wanted officials local state level say vote was tainted wide-spread fraud throw out results even though showed last week there wasn't any voter fraud

remain power donald trump worked ensure they'd face consequences threats people's livelihood lives threats violence donald trump knew about amplified our other hearings can't just look backward what happened late early 2021 because danger hasn't gone away our democracy endured mighty test january 6th days before say our institutions held but what does really mean democratic institutions aren't

elections one county commission refused certify results citing vague unsupported claims dealing with dominion voting machines courts stepped saying new mexico law required commission certify results two three members commission finally relented one still refused saying his vote isn't based any evidence it's not based any facts it's only based gut feeling own intuition that's all need way few

trump begins calling rino republican name only then references conversation november which claims told him election was rigged had arizona quote former president during conversation told election was rigged arizona did have such conversation with president bowers did have conversation with president certainly isn't there were parts are true but there are parts are not sir schiff part read false bowers anywhere anyone any time has said said election was rigged would not true schiff when former president his statement today claimed told him arizona also false bowers also false schiff bowers understand after election--and don't know whether this conversation former president referring to--but after election received phone call from president trump rudy giuliani which discussed results presidential election arizona would tell about call whether former president giuliani raised allegations election fraud bowers thank wife had returned from attending our church meetings was sunday were still driveway had received call from colleague telling white house was trying get touch with her said please get call let's try take this together immediately saw white house bluetooth was calling took call was asked would presume operator white house would hold for president which did giuliani came first niceties then trump president trump then-president trump came initiated conversation schiff during conversation did ask giuliani for proof these allegations fraud was making bowers multiple occasions yes schiff when asked him for evidence this fraud what did say bowers said did have proof asked him have names for example have 200,000 illegal immigrants some large number 5,000 6,000 dead people cetera said have their names yes will give them yes president interrupted said give man what needs rudy said will happened least two occasions interchange conversation schiff giuliani was claiming call there were hundreds thousands undocumented people thousands dead people who had purportedly voted election bowers yes schiff asked him for evidence bowers did schiff did ever receive from him evidence either during call after call this day bowers never schiff what was ask during this call was making these allegations fraud but had something couple things wanted what were those bowers ones remember were first would hold would allow official committee capitol could hear this evidence could take action thereafter refused said time circus--i called circus--had been brewing with lots demonstrations both counting center capitol other places didn't want have house did not feel evidence granted its absence merited hearing didn't want used pawn there was some other need committee hearing would fulfill was first ask hold official committee hearing schiff what was his second ask bowers said what end what end hearing said well have heard official high republican legislature there legal theory legal ability arizona can remove electors president biden replace them would like have legitimate opportunity through committee come end remove said totally new have never heard any such thing pressed point said look are asking something counter oath when swore constitution uphold also swore constitution laws state arizona this totally foreign idea theory would never anything such magnitude without deep consultation with qualified attorneys said have got some good attorneys going give their names but are asking something against oath will not break oath think was point schiff during conversation--and heard think when played snippet giuliani calling other state legislators saying was calling essentially fellow republican--did make similar appeal bring fact shared similar party bowers whether was call later meeting did bring more than once schiff how would bring bowers would say aren't all republicans here would think would get better reception mean would think would listen little more open suggestions are all republicans schiff this evidence asked him for would justify this extraordinary step think said never produced why did feel either absence evidence with what were asking would violate your oath constitution bowers first all when people--and arizona believe some 40-plus years earlier legislature had established manner electing our officials electors for presidential race once was given people bush gore illustrated supreme court becomes fundamental right people far was concerned for someone ask in--i will call paucity there was evidence being presented any strength evidence can hearsay evidence still evidence but still hearsay but strong judicial-quality evidence anything would say have doubt deny your oath will not more than one occasion throughout all this has been brought tenet faith constitution divinely inspired one most basic foundational beliefs for because somebody just asked foreign very being will not schiff during conversation speaker bowers did ask him what was proposing had ever been done before bowers did schiff what did say bowers said well not familiar with arizona law any other laws but don't think also was brought other conversations both with him with john eastman others schiff speaker bowers understand week after call giuliani appeared with others associated with president trump's effort overturn result election purported legislative hearing hotel ballroom phoenix was this official hearing state legislature bowers was not schiff why was not real official hearing legislature bowers legislator can hold group meeting can call hearing but when asked have official hearing establish protocols public notice cetera typically held capitol but doesn't need can authorize hearing off-campus this case had been asked several occasions allow hearing denied but said are free hold meeting any meeting want person who asked which ultimately did think was little frustrated but ultimately did schiff this meeting was same day believe governor arizona doug ducey certified biden winner presidential election arizona did meet with giuliani his associates while were phoenix sometime after purported legislative hearing hotel bowers yes did sir schiff meeting did giuliani raise any specific allegations election fraud again bowers his initial comments were again litany groups illegal individuals people deceased cetera had brought wasn't alone meeting there were others other members senate aggressively questioned him then proceeded question him proof was going bring cetera but did bring those yes schiff these other legislators were also republican members senate bowers were yes sir schiff did also press him for proof those allegations bowers pressed him very strongly two them especially very strongly schiff some point did giuliani ask one other attorneys his team help him out with evidence bowers did asked jenna ellis who was sitting his right one thing was was more point was there sufficient evidence action could justify recalling electors but part conversation know referred someone else but did ask have proof jenna ellis said yes said want names have names yes have how voted have all information said can get information did bring with said both giuliani asked her asked generally had brought with them said not with but can get said then didn't bring evidence which was repeated different iterations for some period time schiff some point did one them make comment didn't have evidence but had lot theories bowers was giuliani schiff what exactly did say how did come bowers recollection said we've got lots theories just don't have evidence don't know was gaffe maybe didn't think through what said but both myself others group three group counsel both remembered specifically afterwards kind-of laughed about schiff getting back ask phone call preceded this meeting wanted have legislature dismiss biden electors replace them with trump electors basis these theories fraud bowers did not say those exact words but did say arizona law according what understood would allowed needed come into session take care which initiated discussion about again what can legally not legally can't into session arizona unilaterally sole prerogative schiff this meeting any later time did anyone provide with evidence election fraud sufficient affect outcome presidential election arizona bowers one provided ever such evidence schiff select committee has uncovered evidence course our investigation stop steal protests state capitols across country there were individuals with ties groups parties involved january 6th attack u.s capitol one those incursions took place arizona house representatives building can see this footage arizona state capitol video footage shown schiff this previously undisclosed video protestors illegally entering refusing leave building one individuals prominently shown this video jacob chansley perhaps better known qanon shaman this rioter entered capitol january 6th was photographed leaving threatening note dais u.s senate chamber was ultimately sentenced months prison after pleading guilty obstruction official proceeding other protesters who occupied arizona house representatives building included proud boys while men armed with rifles stood just outside entrance understand these protestors were calling for name speaker bowers correct bowers correct schiff speaker bowers did president call again later december bowers did sir schiff did tell president second call supported him voted for him but were not going anything illegal for him bowers did sir schiff nevertheless his lawyer john eastman called some days later january 2021 did have very specific ask would have required just what had already told president wouldn't something would violate your oath correct bowers correct wasn't just had counsel others call schiff what did eastman want bowers would fact vote take vote overthrow--or shouldn't say overthrow--that would decertify electors because had plenary authority cited article section 1--i think clause 2--and said his opinion gave authority there was--i don't recall him saying sufficient evidence but there was some call some strong reason we--or justification could was asking we--his suggestion was would said again took oath for take what would counter oath don't recall was conversation clearly talked more about oath but said what would have said just let courts sort out said are asking something has never been done history--the history united states--and going put state through without sufficient proof going good enough with would put through state swore uphold both constitution law sir said well suggestion would just let courts figure all out didn't use exact phrase but what his meaning was declined believe was close end our phone call schiff again this took place after had recently spoken with president trump told him wouldn't anything illegal for him right bowers wasn't days after--obviously was days after but few days had gone schiff but had told president trump would not anything illegal for him bowers did both times schiff told eastman did not believe there was legal support justify what was asking but still wanted effectively let courts work out bowers have been warned don't say things think maybe said but remember him saying authority legislature was plenary can said then should know can't even call legislature into session without two-thirds majority vote are only plus there way could happen schiff but your view what was asking would have violated your oath constitution both united states constitution constitution state arizona bowers yes sir schiff did also receive call from u.s representative andy biggs arizona morning january 6th bowers did schiff what did biggs ask bowers believe was day vote was occurring each state have certification declare certification electors asked would sign both letter had been sent from state and/or would support decertification electors said would not schiff speaker december

session count those votes winner electoral college vote becomes president this next segment will hear how president trump his campaign were directly involved advancing coordinating plot replace legitimate biden electors with fake electors not chosen voters will hear how this campaign convinced these fake electors cast submit their votes through fake certificates telling them their votes would only used event president trump his legal challenges yet when president those legal challenges when courts rejected them frivolous without merit fake elector scheme continued this point president trump's own lawyers so-called team normal walked away rather than participate planning his own white house counsel's office said plan was not legally sound let's play following video produced select committee lucier name casey lucier i'm investigative counsel for house select committee investigate january 6th attack united states capitol november 18th lawyer working with trump campaign named kenneth chesebro wrote memo arguing trump campaign should organize its own electors swing states president trump had select committee received testimony those close president trump began planning organize fake electors for trump states biden weeks after election george who remember being involved those early discussions around thanksgiving time regarding having alternate electors meet hutchinson giuliani several giuliani's associates meadows members congress although it's difficult distinguish members i'm thinking were involved during thanksgiving they're involved progressed through december lucier president's direct request rnc assisted campaign coordinating this effort wood what did president say when called mcdaniel essentially turned call over eastman who then proceeded talk about importance rnc helping campaign gather these contingent electors case any legal challenges were on-going changed result any states think more just helping them reach out assemble them but understanding campaign did take lead just were helping them that--in role lucier president trump his supporters continued lawsuits some campaign lawyers became convinced convening electors states trump was longer appropriate justin clark just remember--i either replied called somebody--saying unless have litigation pending this like these states like don't think this appropriate know this isn't right thing don't remember how phrased but got into little bit back-and-forth think was with ken chesebro where said all right know just get after like i'm out morgan point had josh finley email chesebro politely say this your task are responsible for electoral college issues moving forward this was way taking responsibility zero lucier committee learned white house counsel's office also felt plan was potentially illegal george clear did hear white house counsel's office say this plan have alternate electors meet cast votes for donald trump states had was not legally sound hutchinson yes sir george who was present for meeting remember hutchinson was our offices meadows giuliani few giuliani's associates lucier select committee interviewed several individual fake electors well trump campaign staff who helped organize effort sinners were just know kind-of--kind-of useful idiots rubes point know strong part really feels it's just kind-of road

not have had known three main lawyers for campaign i'd spoken past were leading were not board yeah hitt was told these would only count court ruled our favor would have been using our electors--well would have been using our electors ways weren't told about wouldn't have supported lucier documents obtained select committee indicate instructions were given electors several states needed cast their ballots complete secrecy because this scheme involved fake electors those participating certain states had way comply with state election laws like where electors were supposed meet one group fake electors even considered hiding overnight ensure could access state capitol required michigan george did norton say who was working with all this effort have electors meet cox said was working with president's campaign told michigan republican electors were planning meet capitol hide overnight could fulfill role casting their vote in--per law--in michigan chambers told him uncertain terms was

submitted them national archives vice president pence his capacity president senate here what some fake electors certificates look like compared real ones but these ballots had legal effect email

because tweeted about later day let's take look what president said tweet donald trump claims there was massive voter fraud georgia sterling was just plain false wasn't sterling yes sir schiff nevertheless very next day december 2nd president trump released lengthy video again making false claims election fraud georgia let's take look what said this time president trump found thousands thousands votes were out whack--all against schiff fact day after donald trump released video--so now are talking just days after emotional warning gave someone going get killed--representatives president trump appeared georgia including rudy giuliani launched new conspiracy theory would take life its own threaten lives several innocent election workers this story falsely alleges sometime during election night election workers state farm arena atlanta georgia kicked out poll observers after observers left story goes these workers pulled so-called suitcases ballots from under table ran those ballots through counting machines multiple times completely without evidence president trump his allies claimed these suitcases contained many 18,000 ballots all for joe biden none this was true but rudy giuliani appeared before committee georgia state senate played surveillance video from state farm arena falsely claiming showed this conspiracy taking place here sample what giuliani had say during hearing giuliani when look what saw video which was smoking gun powerful smoking gun well don't--don't have genius figure out what happened i--i don't have genius figure out those votes are not legitimate votes don't put legitimate votes under table voice giuliani continuing wait until throw opposition out middle night count them would have fools think schiff president trump's campaign amplified giuliani's false testimony tweet pushing out video footage giuliani likewise pushed out his testimony social media can see this tweet giuliani wrote was now beyond doubt fulton county democrats had stolen election later this hearing will hear directly from one election workers this video about effect these lies had her her family sterling did investigators your office review entire surveillance tape from state farm arena election night sterling actually reviewed approximately hours going over time period where action was taking place counting center state farm arena schiff what did tape actually show sterling depending which time want start because was mentioned this conspiracy theory took life its own where conflated water main break wasn't water main break throwing observers out series other things what actually showed was fulton county election workers engaging normal ballot processing one specific things--one things was very frustrating was so-called suitcases ballots from under table watched entirety video saw these were election workers who were under impression were going get home around 10:30 people are putting their coats are putting ballots are prepared scanned into ballot carriers are then sealed with tamper-proof seals know are not messed with interesting thing because watch all of--there are four screens video are watching can see election monitors corner with press are taking these ballot carriers putting them under table see there one other hidden ones looked actual tape was outside table just from camera angle couldn't see originally this goes under good deed goes unpunished were told at--we were gema secretary pointed out--and were told looked like were shutting down fulton county counting secretary expressed some displeasure because wanted everybody keep counting could get results know what was happening our elections director called their elections director who was another election because this was election day there was two different places where ballot things were being done fulton county office called elections director for fulton then called ralph jones who was state farm arena said what heck are doing ahead stay watch video itself see him take phone call people are putting things away getting ready leave can tell for about seconds does not want tell these people have stay walks over thinks about for second see him come back corner desk kind-of slumps his shoulders says okay y'all gotta keep counting then see them take their coats off get ballots out then secondary thing will see there will have people who are counting ballots who batch will through will take them off run through again what happens there standard operating procedure there mis-scan there misalignment doesn't read right these are high-speed high-capacity scanners will through after mis-scan have delete batch put back through again going through hand tally secretary pointed out showed there had been multiple ballots scanned without corresponding physical ballot your counts would have been lot higher than ballots themselves doing hand tally saw two specific numbers were met hand tally got 1053 percent off total votes cast 0099 percent margin which essentially dead-on accurate most academic studies say hand tally will have between percent but because use ballot-marking devices where very clear what voter intended made lot easier for conduct hand count show none was true schiff now understand when reviewed these tapes did analysis disproved this conspiracy theory but still had take lot steps try make sure public knew truth about these allegations did frequent briefings for press let's take look one those press briefings sterling held december 7th make point just did today sterling move what i'm going call disinformation monday out gate many all saw videotape from state farm arena spent hours with our post-certified investigators justin gray from wsb spent hours with going over this video explain people what saw--the secret suitcases magic ballots--were actually ballots had been packed into those absentee ballot carriers workers plain view monitors press what's really frustrating president's attorneys had this same videotape saw exact same things rest could see chose mislead state senators public about what was video i'm quite sure will not characterize video try enter into evidence because kind thing can lead sanctions because it's obviously untrue knew was untrue continue things like this schiff sterling despite efforts your office combat this misinformation speaking out publicly through local media were unable match reach president trump's platform social media megaphone spreading these false conspiracy theories what was like compete with president who had biggest bully pulpit world push out these false claims sterling for lack better word was frustrating but oftentimes felt our information was getting out but there was reticence people who needed believe believe because president united states whom many looked respected was telling them wasn't true despite facts have characterized one point was kind-of like shovel trying empty ocean yes was frustrating even have know family members who had argue with about some these things would show them things--and problem have are getting people's hearts remember this one specific--an attorney know showed walked him through this wasn't true okay get this wasn't true okay get this wasn't true--five six things but end goes just know heart cheated once get past heart facts don't matter much our job from our point view was get facts out our job tell truth follow constitution follow law defend institutions institutions held schiff let's take look what were competing with this former president

witnesses who advised vice president regarding his role january 6th judge michael luttig one leading conservative legal thinkers country served administrations president ronald reagan george h.w bush was appointed latter serve u.s court appeals for fourth circuit where served from 1991 2006 provided critical advice for vice president pence regarding role vice president joint session congress shortly before fateful moment has written vice president does not have power select next president united states has also written contrary theory espoused one his own former law clerks was incorrect every turn are also joined today one people who was with vice president pence january 6th greg jacob was counsel vice president pence conducted thorough analysis role vice president joint session

danger will now swear our witnesses witnesses will please stand raise their right hands witnesses sworn chairman thompson thank may seated let record reflect witnesses answered affirmative now recognize myself for questions united states people choose our representatives including highest official land president united states american people did this november but president trump did not like outcome did everything could change result election tried litigation--62 cases fact--and failed tried pressure state legislatures reverse results election their states but refused tried enlist department justice his efforts overturn election results but officials leading department refused comply eventually latched completely nonsensical antidemocratic theory one man his own vice president could determine outcome election wanted vice president unilaterally select president this theory vice president could unilaterally select president runs completely contrary our constitution our laws entirety our american experience but didn't matter president trump would now like explore how president trump came latch onto this ridiculous legal theory vice president can select president united states jacob how did this theory first come your attention jacob first time had conversation with vice president about 12th amendment electoral count act was early december around december 7th vice president called over his west wing office told had been seeing reading things suggested had significant role play january 6th announcing outcome election told had been first elected congress 2000 one his earliest memories congressman was sitting 2001 certification recalled gore had gaveled down number objections had been raised florida asked mechanically how does this work joint session what are rules told vice president fact had fairly good idea how things worked actually there aren't rules govern joint session but what there provision constitution just one sentence long then electoral count act had been passed 1887 told vice president could put memo together for him overnight would explain applicable rules chairman thompson jacob when looked this theory what did conclude jacob concluded what have sentence constitution inartfully drafted but vice president's first instinct when heard this theory was there was way our framers who abhorred concentrated power who had broken away from tyranny george iii would ever have put one person--particularly not person who had direct interest outcome because were ticket for election--in role have decisive impact outcome election our review text history frankly just common sense all confirmed vice president's first instinct point there justifiable basis conclude vice president has kind authority chairman thompson thank jacob will hear more today about how despite this conclusion other top legal advisors former president used this discredited theory his campaign pressure vice president decide outcome presidential election now recognize gentlewoman from wyoming cheney for questions vice chair cheney thank very much chairman judge luttig thank well for being here with today issued very important statement earlier today which urge all americans read would like ask judge about one sentences your statement ask could explain significance say had vice president united states obeyed president united states america would immediately have been plunged into what would have been tantamount revolution within paralyzing constitutional crisis would elaborate for judge judge luttig thank madam vice chair passage statement this morning referenced most foundational concept america which rule law thus interpret your question are asking about foundational truth these united states which call america foundational truth rule law foundational truth for united states america profound truth but not merely profound truth for united states also simple truth simple foundational truth american republic thus view hearings being conducted this select committee are examining profound truth--namely rule law united states america specific question course before before nation--not before me--is whether foundational rule law was supremely violated january 2021 now question specifically asked madam vice chair believe had vice president pence obeyed orders from his president--and president united states america--during joint session congress united states january 2021 declared donald trump next president united states notwithstanding then-president trump had electoral college vote well popular vote presidential election declaration donald trump next president would have plunged america into what believe would have been tantamount revolution within constitutional crisis america which view--and only one man--would have been first constitutional crisis since founding republic vice chair cheney thank very much judge for your solemn attention these issues for your appearance here today are going describe discuss detail what happened going describe few details now some actions taken gentleman named kenneth chesebro after electoral college met cast their votes december 14th--actually day before met--kenneth chesebro sent memo rudy giuliani president's lead outside counsel chesebro wrote mayor giuliani vice president charged with making judgments about what there are conflicting votes chesebro wrote when joint session congress got arizona alphabetical list states vice president should not count biden votes because there are two slates votes his justification which will learn more about our next hearing was group trump supporters arizona other swing states decided proclaim themselves true electors for state creating two sets electors--the official electors selected state group fake electors this document was ordered produced select committee federal district court judge will see screen shortly judge david carter wrote draft memo pushed strategy knowingly violated electoral count act judge concluded memo both intimately related clearly advanced plan obstruct joint session congress january 2021 few days later professor john eastman took this cause eastman was time law professor chapman university law school prepared memo outlining nonsensical theory vice president could decide outcome election joint session congress january 6th will see portions this memo screen first line wrote states have transmitted dual slates electors president senate but eastman goes rely those so-called dual slates electors say vice president pence could simply declare president trump winner election jacob were there fact dual slates electors from states jacob there were not vice chair cheney just few days after eastman wrote another memo this one war gaming out several scenarios knew outcome wanted saw way forward simply pretended fake electors were real will see memo screen now here eastman says vice president can reject biden electors from states calls disputed under several scenarios vice president could ultimately just declare donald trump winner regardless vote totals had already been certified states however this was false eastman knew was false other words was lie fact december just days before eastman sent this memo eastman himself admitted email fake electors had legal weight referring fake electors dead arrival congress because did not have certification from their states judge luttig did trump electors those states who were not certified any state authority have any legal significance judge luttig congresswoman there was support whatsoever either constitution united states nor laws united states for vice president frankly ever count alternative electoral slates from states had not been officially certified designated state official electoral count act 1887 did notice passage from eastman's memorandum took note correct wrong but said passage there was both legal authority well historical precedent know what eastman was referring when said there was historical precedent for doing was incorrect there was historical precedent from beginning founding 1789 even mere historical precedent distinguished from legal precedent would support possibility vice president united states counting alternative electoral slates had not been officially certified congress pursuant electoral count act 1887 would glad explain historical precedent committee wanted but would digression vice chair cheney thank very much judge know colleagues will pursuing issue more depth now would like yield back chairman chairman thompson thank very much pursuant section 5(c)(8 house resolution 503 chair recognizes gentleman from california aguilar staff counsel john wood for questioning aguilar thank chairman are fortunate have bipartisan staff senior investigative counsel john wood previously served united states attorney missouri under president george bush will share today's lines questioning wood wood thank aguilar judge luttig had incredible honor serving one your law clerks another person who did was john eastman have written eastman's theory vice president could determine who next president united states your words incorrect every turn could please explain briefly your analysis judge luttig was honor wood have serve law clerk could answer question perfectly had disposal either eastman's tweet own analytical tweet september 21st but don't but said let try remember eastman's analysis wood judge can read audience think what was really key passage from your very insightful analysis when wrote believe(d professor eastman was incorrect every turn analysis his january memorandum beginning with his claim there were legitimate competing slates electors presented from states have already addressed issue but your next sentence said continuing his conclusion vice president could unilaterally decide not count votes from states from which competing slates were allegedly presented what was your basis for concluding eastman was incorrect his conclusion vice president could unilaterally decide not count votes from these disputed states judge luttig understand previously stated response congresswoman cheney there was basis constitution laws united states all for theory espoused eastman--at all none with all respect co-panelist said believe partial response one select committee's questions single sentence 12th amendment was thought inartfully written single sentence not inartfully written was pristine clear president senate january 6th incumbent vice president united states had little substantive constitutional authority any all 12th amendment single sentence jacob refers says substance following transmission certificates congress united states under electoral count act 1887 archivist united states presiding officer shall open certificates presence congress united states joint session then says unmistakably not even vice president himself shall count electoral votes clearly says merely electoral count votes shall then counted was electoral count act 1887 filled will simple words 12th amendment order construct for country process for counting of--the sacred process for counting of--the electoral votes from states neither our original constitution nor even 12th amendment had done irony will from its founding until 1887 when congress passed electoral count act nation had been considerable turmoil during least its presidential elections beginning soon thereafter from founding 1800 wasn't for almost 100 years later until electoral count act was passed why view piece legislation not only work progress for country but this moment history important work progress needs take place was long-winded understand wood well judge luttig risk oversimplifying for non-lawyers who are watching fair say 12th amendment basically says two things happen vice president opens certificates electoral votes are counted straightforward judge luttig would not want testimony before congress united states language 12th amendment simple wood thank judge jacob have question for believe during your deposition before this committee said something effect had read every word written about 12th amendment electoral count act historical practice know response chairman's earlier question gave your bottom-line conclusion but can tell little bit about process your colleagues went through researching this issue what conclusion came after your thorough research jacob lawyer who analyzing constitutional provision start with constitutional text structure history started with text did not think text was quite unambiguous judge luttig indicated part had constitutional crisis 1876 because year multiple slates electors were certified multiple states when came time count those votes antecedent question which ones had answered required appointment independent commission commission had had resolve question purpose electoral count act 1887 had been resolve those latent ambiguities now complete agreement with judge luttig unambiguous vice president does not have authority reject electors there suggestion any kind does there mention rejecting objecting electors anywhere 12th amendment notion vice president could certainly not text but problem had john eastman raised our discussions was had all seen congress 2000 2004 2016 there had been objections raised various states those had even been debated 2004 here have amendment says nothing about objecting rejecting yet did have some recent practice happening within terms electoral count act started with text recall discussion with vice president said can't wait heaven meet framers tell them work did putting together our constitution work genius thank was divinely inspired there one sentence would like talk little bit about then went structure again vice president's first instinct here decisive this question there just way framers constitution who divided power authority who separated out who had broken away from george iii declared him tyrant--there was way would have put hands one person authority determine who was going president united states then went history examined every single electoral vote count had happened congress since beginning country examined electoral count act examined practice under electoral count act critically vice president 230 years history had ever claimed have kind authority hadn't claimed authority reject electoral votes had not claimed authority return electoral votes back states entire history united states not once had joint session ever returned electoral votes back states counted crisis 1876 justice bradley u.s supreme court who supplied decisive final vote commission had specifically looked question said first vice president clearly doesn't have authority decide anything way also does not have authority conduct investigation sending things back out for public look things history was absolutely decisive again part discussion with eastman was were right don't think gore might have liked have known 2000 had authority just declare himself president united states did think democrat lawyers just didn't think this very obvious quirk could use course acknowledged gore did not should not have had authority point time but text structure history think what had was some ambiguous text common sense structure would tell answer cannot possibly vice president has authority--as committee already played vice president's remarks there almost idea more un-american than notion any one person would choose american president--and then unbroken historical practice for 230 years vice president did not have such authority wood thank reserve remainder time aguilar jacob weren't only one who knew legal theory was wrong though here what various advisors president thought about theory heaphy had been clear repeatedly with meadows about vice president having different view about his authority january 6th short believe had heaphy did meadows ever explicitly tacitly agree with say yeah makes sense okay short believe that--that mark did agree heaphy what makes say short believe that's what told but mentioned think mark had told many people many different things was not something that--that would necessarily accept okay well means that's resolved heaphy see tell more what--what told this topic short well think was know vice president doesn't have any broader role think was understanding heaphy despite fact may have said other things president others said understands vice president has role short yes heaphy okay did say several times short couple times um-hmm heaphy before january 6th short yes jason miller way was communicated was pat cipollone thought idea was--was nutty had one point confronted eastman basically with same sentiment short pat expressed his admiration for vice president's actions day 6th said concurred with legal analysis that--that our team had--had put together reach point herschmann made sense all protections were built into constitution for president get elected steps had taken the--or choose next president would sitting at--with vice president george know clark morgan--is morgan viewed about that--thought about eastman's advice jason miller yeah thought was crazy george know ever expressed opinion whether thought vice president had power john eastman said did jason miller know for fact heard both say his theory was crazy there was validity any way shape form george did express before january 6th jason miller yes george whom jason miller think anyone who would listen wood okay what were your prior interactions with eastman herschmann described for what thought ambiguity was statute was walking through time said hold second want understand what you're saying you're saying believe vice president acting president senate can sole decision maker under your theory who becomes next president united states said yes said are out your effing mind right i--you know was pretty blunt said you're completely crazy said you're going turn around tell 78-plus million people this country your theory this how you're going invalidate their votes because think election was stolen said they're not going tolerate said you're going cause riots streets said words effect there has been violence history our country eric protect democracy protect republic aguilar fact there was risk lawyers white house counsel's office would resign for example fox news host sean hannity expressed concern entire white house counsel's office could quit can see from these texts hannity wrote white house chief staff mark meadows can't entire counsels office not see january happening way being told few days later january 5th hannity wrote meadows i'm very worried about next hours pence pressure counsel will leave while sean hannity was apparently very concerned about possibility white house counsel would resign protest president's effort force vice president violate constitution some others close president were more dismissive white house counsel's position here what trump's son-in-law senior advisor jared kushner said during his deposition regarding white house counsel pat cipollone's threats resign vice chair cheney jared are aware instances where pat cipollone threatened resign kushner i--i kind-of--like said interest time was trying get many pardons done know know was always--to him team were always saying we're going resign we're not going here this happens happens kind-of took just whining honest with aguilar president's own lead outside counsel rudy giuliani also seemed concede vice president did not have authority decide outcome election send back states here what white house attorney eric herschmann said about his call with mayor giuliani morning 6th herschmann morning january 6th think called out blue right was like getting dressed had intellectual discussion that--about eastman's--i don't know it's eastman's theory per but vp's role know was asking view analysis then practical implications when finished said like believe know you're probably right think thought when were done would something he'd have consider was sitting bench but he'd probably come down know couldn't interpret sustain argument long-term aguilar course fact mayor giuliani seemed admit theory was wrong did not stop him from going before crowd just few hours later january 6th saying exact opposite here mayor giuliani's speech ellipse rally january 6th giuliani we're here just very briefly make a--very important two points every single thing has been outlined plan for today perfectly legal have professor eastman here with say few words about he's one preeminent constitutional scholars united states perfectly appropriate given questionable constitutionality election counting act 1887 vice president can cast aside can what president called jefferson did when was vice president applause can decide--he can decide validity these crooked ballots can send back legislatures give them days finally finish work aguilar here what eastman said his speech ellipse january 6th eastman all are demanding vice president pence this afternoon o'clock let legislatures state look into this get bottom american people know whether have control direction our government not applause aguilar even eastman knew his theory didn't hold water jacob discussed even debated this theory length with eastman did eastman ever tell what thought u.s supreme court would had decide this issue jacob yes had extended discussion hour-and a-half hours january 5th when pressed him point said john vice president did what are asking him would nothing supreme court wouldn't initially started well think maybe would only 7-2 after some further discussion acknowledged well yes are right would 9-nothing aguilar appreciate our investigation select committee has obtained evidence suggesting eastman never really believed his own theory let explain screen can see draft letter president from october this letter idea was proposed vice president could determine which electors count joint session congress but person writing blue eviscerates argument person who wrote comments blue wrote 12th amendment only says president senate opens ballots joint session then passive voice votes shall then counted comments blue further state nowhere does suggest president senate gets make determination his own judge luttig does surprise author those comments blue was fact john eastman judge luttig yes does congressman but let me--watching this unfold let try unpack what was root what have called blueprint overturn election this foreshadowed this answer earlier testimony congresswoman cheney eastman from beginning said president there was both legal well historical precedent for vice president overturn election what have heard today believe what happened within white house elsewhere all players led eastman got wrapped around axle historical evidence claim eastman let explain very simply this what have said would require digression would glad undertake wish short had been advising vice president united states january 6th even then-vice president jefferson even then-vice president john adams even then-vice president richard nixon had done exactly what president united states wanted his vice president would have laid body across road before would have let vice president overturn election basis historical precedent but what this body needs know--and now america needs know--is was centerpiece plan overturn election was historical precedent years with vice presidents named congressman raskin understands well effort eastman others was drive historical precedent under single sentence single pristine sentence 12th amendment united states constitution taking advantage will what many have said inartful wording sentence 12th amendment scholars before would have used historical precedent argue not vice president pence could overturn election accepting noncertified state electoral votes but would have made arguments some substantive not merely procedural authority possessed vice president united states statutorily prescribed day for counting electoral college votes this constitutional mischief aguilar judge think good point think kind-of begs question vice president had this power determine outcome presidential election why hasn't ever been used before why hasn't ever happened why hasn't vice president simply rejected outcome election declared someone else winner instead chairman mentioned his opening for over two centuries vice presidents have presided over joint sessions congress purely ceremonial role this even includes jacob mentioned vice president gore for those who are old enough remember 2000 election came down one state florida there were weeks recounts litigation after election gore conceded course gore was vice president time but never suggested could simply declare himself winner 2000 election when presided over counting electoral votes let's hear what vice president gore said when described situation faced 2000 vice president gore i]mportance united states america all human history lincoln's phrase still are last best hope humankind choice between one's own disappointment your personal career upholding the--the noble traditions america's democracy it's pretty easy choice when comes down aguilar jacob did eastman say whether would want other vice presidents such gore after 2000 election kamala harris after 2024 election have power decide outcome election jacob this was one many points discussed january 5th had come into meeting trying persuade there was some validity his theory viewed objective persuade him acknowledge was just wrong thought this had one most powerful arguments mean john back 2000 weren't jumping saying gore had this authority would not want kamala harris able exercise kind authority 2024 when hope republicans will election know hope too john said absolutely gore did not have basis 2000 kamala harris shouldn't able 2024 but think should today aguilar marc short told select committee vice president pence consulted with one his predecessors vice president dan quayle regarding role vice president vice president quayle confirmed pence's view role was purely ceremonial short also told committee short received call from former house speaker paul ryan here short's description his conversation with speaker ryan short speaker ryan wanted call say know don't have any greater authority i--i said him speaker you--you know mike know doesn't--you know recognizes sort-of laughed about said get later spoke vice president too think have same conversation aguilar fortunately for fate our republic vice president pence refused along with president trump's demands determine outcome presidential election jacob what was vice president's reaction when discussed with him theory vice president could decide outcome election jacob congressman have testified vice president's first instinct was there was way any one person particularly vice president who ticket has vested outcome election could possibly have authority decide rejecting electors decisively alter outcome suspending joint session for first time history order try get different outcome from state legislatures aguilar despite fact vice president had strongly held correct view could not decide outcome election president trump launched multi-week campaign both public private pressure get vice president mike pence violate constitution here are some examples intense pressure vice president faced from all sides what his chief staff thought president trump hope mike pence comes through for have tell applause hope our great vice president--our great vice president comes through for he's great guy course doesn't come through won't like him quite much laughter heaphy was your impression vice president had directly conveyed his position these issues president not just world through dear colleague letter but directly president trump short many times heaphy he'd been consistent conveying his position president short very consistent giuliani am--i aware fact president was upset with way pence acted bannon are assume this going climactic battle eastman well think lot depends courage spine individuals involved bannon would nice way say guy named mike--vice president mike pence eastman yes short think we'd been clear what vice president's role was think vice president made clear with president think i'd been clear with mark meadows jason miller think vice president going throw down tomorrow right thing because lou like said before this time for choosing people are going look back this moment tomorrow remember where every single one their elected officials were did vote for rule law getting these elections right did give away democrats people who cheated stole their way through this election definitely the--you know got back into town approximately like 5th 6th president was know all attention was what mike would what mike wouldn't short vice president really was not wavering his commitment what he--what his responsibility was yeah was it--was painful sure aguilar president's pressure campaign started december for example although vice president made his views clearly unmistakably known president others white house december 23rd president trump retweeted memo from individual named ivan raiklin entitled operation pence card called vice president refuse electoral college votes from certain states had certified joe biden winner president trump started his pressure campaign december but dialed pressure january 6th approached testimony have received our investigation indicates time january 4th arrived president trump had already engaged multi-week campaign pressure vice president decide outcome election this had included private conversations between two leaders trump's tweets least one meeting with members congress understand vice president started his day january 4th with rally georgia for republican candidates u.s senate runoff when vice president returned washington was summoned meet with president regarding upcoming joint session congress jacob who attended meeting jacob attendees were vice president president marc short chief staff vice president myself john eastman there was about 5-minute period where mark meadows came different issue aguilar let's show photo meeting jacob during meeting between president vice president what theories did eastman present regarding role vice president counting electoral votes jacob during meeting january 4th eastman was opining there were two legally viable arguments authorities vice president could exercise days later january 6th one them was could reject electoral votes outright other was could use his capacity presiding officer suspend proceedings declare essentially 10-day recess during which states deemed disputed--there was list states exact number changed from conversation conversation--but vice president could sort-of issue demand state legislatures those states reexamine election declare who had each those states said both those were legally viable options said did not recommend upon questioning did not recommend what called more aggressive option which was reject outright because thought would less politically palatable imprimatur state legislature authority would necessary ultimately have public acceptance outcome favor president trump advocated preferred course action would procedural route suspending joint session sending election back states aguilar jacob know won't discuss direct conversations between president vice president rather than asking what vice president said meeting will ask more general question did vice president ever waver his position could not unilaterally decide which electors accept jacob vice president never budged from position have described his first instinct which was just made sense from everything knew had studied about our constitution one person would have kind authority aguilar did vice president ever waver his position could not delay certification send back states jacob did not aguilar did eastman admit front president his proposal would violate electoral count act jacob during meeting 4th think raised problem both eastman's proposals would violate several provisions electoral count act eastman acknowledged was case even what viewed more politically palatable option would violate several provisions but thought could because his view electoral count act was unconstitutional when raised concerns position would likely court his view was court simply wouldn't get involved would invoke political question doctrine therefore could have some comfort proceeding with path aguilar wood wood but just reiterate told you--maybe this was later conversation--but told some point fact issue ever got supreme court his theory would 9-0 correct jacob next morning starting around 11:30 met for hour-and-a-half hours meeting have already described text structure history conversation but started walking through all said john basically what have some texts may little bit ambiguous but then nothing else would support including fact nobody would ever want rule wouldn't nothing supreme court again initially started well maybe would only 7-2 but ultimately acknowledged would 9-0 judge would support his argument aguilar after his meeting with vice president donald trump flew georgia for rally support republican candidates u.s senate runoff even though vice president had been steadfast resisting president's pressure president trump continued publicly pressure vice president pence his georgia speech rather than focusing exclusively georgia senate runoff trump turned his attention mike pence here what president said during rally georgia president trump p]ence comes through for have tell applause hope our great vice president--our great vice president comes through for he's great guy course doesn't come through won't like him quite much laughter aguilar president had been told multiple times vice president could not affect outcome election but nonetheless publicly pressured mike pence exactly saying doesn't come through won't like him much let's turn now january 5th wood wood thank morning meaning january 5th president issued tweet expressly stating vice president had power reject electors let's look what president wrote vice president has power reject fraudulently chosen electors jacob have already told about your meeting with eastman president january 4th briefly made reference meeting had with eastman next day january 5th can tell little bit more about meeting with eastman january 5th for example where was meeting who was there jacob conclusion meeting 4th president had asked our office meet with eastman next day hear more about positions had expressed meeting vice president indicated that--offered his counsel fulfill duty met marc short's office executive office building across way from white house eastman had court hearing zoom morning didn't start first thing but rather started around meeting went for about hour-and-a-half hours chief staff marc short was meeting most time there were few times left essentially was extended discussion what most surprised about meeting was when eastman came said here request reject electors 4th had been path had said not recommending but 5th came expressly requested grabbed notebook because was heading into meeting didn't hear much new from him record but was first thing recorded notes was request reject wood just clear are saying eastman urged vice president adopt very same approach eastman appeared abandon oval office meeting with president day before correct jacob had recommended against evening before then 5th came in--and think was probably his first words after introductions sat down were here request reject electors disputed states wood referenced moment ago some handwritten notes which have provided select committee would now like show those notes can see wrote there top--the writing little bit faint copy--but wrote requesting reject does accurately reflect what eastman asked your meeting january 5th jacob yes wood what was your reaction when eastman said january 5th was there ask vice president united states reject electors joint session congress jacob was surprised because had viewed one key concessions had secured night before from eastman was not recommending wood what did say him jacob well indicated some extent simplified task because there are more procedural complexities send back states point view actually had spent most evening night before writing memorandum vice president explaining all specific provisions electoral count act plan would violate instead since was pushing sort-of robust unilateral power theory--i have already walked committee through discussions had--again started out with our points commonality--or what thought were our points commonality--we are conservatives are small government people believe originalism means which are going interpret this walked through text walked through history committee has shown footage eastman stage 6th claiming jefferson supported his position historical example jefferson fact conceded meeting jefferson did not all support his position election 1800 there had been some small technical defect with certificate georgia was absolutely undisputed jefferson had georgia jefferson did not assert had any authority reject electors did not assert had any authority resolve any issue during course acknowledged end there was historical practice whatsoever supported his position had initially tried push examples jefferson adams ultimately acknowledged did not work have covered acknowledged would 9-0 supreme court again tried say but don't think courts will get involved this will invoke political question doctrine courts stay out will mean will have days for states weigh resolve then will send back trump slates electors people will able accept expressed vociferous disagreement with point did not think this was political question among other things courts did not step resolve this there was nobody else resolve would situation where have standoff between president united states counterfactually vice president united states saying have exercised authorities constitutionally think have which have deemed ourselves winners election would have opposed house senate disagreeing with would have state legislatures point mean republican leaders across those legislatures had put together--had put out statements--and collected these for vice president well--that people had spoken their states had intention reversing outcome election did receive some signed letters eastman forwarded minorities leaders those states but state had any legislative house indicated had any interest would have had just unprecedented constitutional jump ball situation with stand-off expressed him issue might well then have decided streets because can't work out politically have already seen how charged people are about this election would disastrous situation said think courts will intervene not see commitment constitution question whether vice president has authority some other actor resolve there are arguments about whether congress vice president jointly have constitutional commitment generally decide electoral vote issues don't think have any authority object reject them don't see 12th amendment but nonetheless concluded saying john light everything have discussed can't just both agree this terrible idea couldn't quite bring himself say yes but very clearly said well yes see are not going able persuade this was how meeting concluded wood just described terrifying scenario sounds like there could have been chaos under eastman approach have described potentially could decided streets described several concessions eastman made throughout discussion even debate had with him some point during meeting january 5th did eastman seem admit both theories had presented united states day before--so theory vice president could reject electors outright declare donald trump winner his less aggressive theory vice president could simply send back states--at some point conversation 5th did eastman seem admit both these theories suffered from similar legal flaws jacob had least one possibly two other conversations with eastman later day earlier meeting really were focused because his request made had been reject electors outright why theory was wrong why certainly would not doing later day pivoted back well hear loud clear are not going reject but remember last night said there was this more prudent course where could just send back states would willing during course our discussion about his renewed request consider option acknowledged me--he put it--both eastman myself are graduates university chicago law school said look graduates august institution will mutually understand underlying legal theory plenary vice presidential authority what have have get there because this new theory was pointing out him--or procedural theory--still violates several provisions electoral count act acknowledged only way could ever able ignore several provisions statutory law was pretty clear were unconstitutional only way could unconstitutional vice president had plenary authorities formed basis for reject votes well acknowledged those conversations underlying legal theory was same just thought send back states option would more politically palatable hoped more palatable vice president for reason wood fact when eastman made this concession during meeting according your earlier deposition eastman said just between university chicago chickens right jacob don't think university chicago going start chicago chickens fundraising fund but yes terminology used said know just between chicago chickens will understand lawyers who have studied constitution underlying basis really same wood reserve remainder time aguilar thank wood jacob president vice president meet again same topic next day january 5th correct jacob after extended meeting with eastman morning during time vice president had been back his residence working his statement nation released next day got down white house some point between o'clock o'clock meeting with eastman was wrapping when marc short went over meet with vice president and--actually thought maybe had good news felt like had sort-of defeated eastman was sort-of acknowledging there was there there but vice president was then asked down oval office went down oval office while marc stayed back vice president's office aguilar weren't meeting jacob was not aguilar book peril journalists bob woodward robert costa write president said these people say have power wouldn't want vice president says wouldn't want any one person have authority president responds but wouldn't almost cool have power vice president reported have said look have read this don't see way have exhausted every option have done everything could then some find way around this simply not possible interpretation which president says don't understand mike can this don't want your friend anymore don't this asked marc short about this during his deposition short a]n understanding would have other conversations with vice president articulated wouldn't want power bestowed upon any one person aguilar jacob did short vice president have call later day again with president eastman jacob yes did aguilar what did eastman request call jacob phone call which believe was around o'clock afternoon eastman stated had heard loud clear morning were not going rejecting electors but would open considering other course had discussed 4th which would suspend joint session request state legislatures reexamine certification electoral votes aguilar same day january 5th new york times ran story about disagreement between president vice president about whether vice president could determine outcome election even though new york times story was indisputably correct donald trump denied trump issued statement claiming vice president had agreed could determine outcome election despite fact vice president had consistently rejected position let's look what president said his statement new york times report regarding comments vice president pence supposedly made today fake news never said vice president are total agreement vice president has power act jacob how did vice president's team react this statement from president vice president could take active role determining winner presidential election jacob were shocked disappointed because whoever had written put statement out was categorically untrue aguilar vice president's chief staff marc short had angry phone call with trump campaign senior advisor jason miller about this statement here what short miller told committee about call heaphy okay tell about conversation had with jason short was brief was irritated expressed displeasure statement could have gone out misrepresented vice president's viewpoint without consultation heaphy statement says vice president are total agreement vice president has power act incorrect short think record shows that's incorrect heaphy yeah short mean we've--we've been through many documents clarify this not where vice president was heaphy right essentially president sending out baldly false statement about being alignment purported alignment with vice president despite all predicate indicated had gone before about their respective positions effectively what happened short interpret statement false i'll let figure out who sent out george when marc short contacted he--he was upset what said jason miller clearly was not pleased george tell what said jason miller what's process for putting out statement for meeting where only two people were room george did ask retract statement jason miller just--i think went right what's process for putting out statement for meeting when only two people were room george clearly disagreed with substance though right because said that--he said vice president doesn't agree with this jason miller i'm trying think what exactly said mean the--the tone was very clearly he'd--that he'd used some language strongly infer vice president disagreed with--with take but don't remember what language was heaphy did dictate this statement jason miller we--he dictated--he dictated most mean typically these--typically these might have couple wording suggestions maybe i'd know have a--a sense rough framework something but i--i know with--specifically this one was him phone talking through ultimately

republicans are stung our arguments about voter fraud big lie republican leader has actually tried argue actually democrats pushing big lie when warn about voter suppression threats voter suppression are not false are dangerous republican leader's line argument gas-lighting pure simple republican leader has pointed repeatedly experience election proof somehow there exists effort suppress vote but ignores problem today not just about what happened during election about what happened after happening today leader mcconnell doesn't want get into specifics about laws passed republican legislators across this country limit right vote then democrats will despite fact election was free fair accurate year followed least states suddenly decided rewrite rules govern way people voted their respective states least 33--33--new laws have passed across country will make harder vote harder register vote worst all potentially empower partisans arbitrate outcomes future elections instead nonpartisan election workers may just beginning because legislatures various states are preparing new laws enter 2022 sessions their legislatures ask republican colleagues take look what has happened many republican-led state legislatures when republicans states like texas reduce polling hours polling locations how does not make harder for people vote when republicans states like florida kansas iowa texas make harder for people even register vote--even register vote--how not suppressing their fundamental right vote all what does have with election security when republicans states like georgia indiana florida cut back number availability locations where people can drop off their absentee ballots how can republicans say voting hasn't been made harder when republicans states like georgia make crime give food water people waiting line polls how not making harder for them cast ballot some examples are especially egregious according one recent report lincoln county georgia looking eliminate all but one polling location entire county before next election--one location whole big county disgusting some voters who live county would have drive miles just drop off ballot this way makes voting more convenient makes enormous burden let's abundantly clear these new anti-voter laws are books today because their authors cited big lie cited fictitious bugaboo voter fraud are trying succeed where

president right can't happen can't let happen have obligation not let happen because history shows when ignore paint over this kind violent action will recur often worse form than had originally what history shows didn't look away after attack pearl harbor didn't look away after attacks 9/11 may have been from foreign powers but still--just because was americans who did this cannot look away after attack january what must instead stare truth however ugly face attack january didn't come out blue was not act god was not something came from foreign soil wasn't even just some mere protest got out hand january was attempt reverse through violent means outcome free fair election insurrection--call what what was was fundamentally rooted donald trump's big lie election was illegitimate deep offense peaceful transfer power--indeed deep offense very notion truth itself anyone who thinks origins this insurrection are going away should just have listened few moments ago when donald trump did again--lying lying lying about election clear reminder threat his lie remain our nation alarmingly--alarmingly--many his supporters quickly embraced lie aftermath election many them truly believed still believe election game was rigged--not small number large numbers americans look polls tens millions didn't matter there was proof any these claims donald trump kept saying saying saying again called his supporters rally here washington last-ditch effort stay power all know this what happened can't forget was donald trump's big lie soaked our political landscape kerosene was donald trump's rally mall struck match then came fire pouring gasoline fire are many one branch our media who spread big lie then continue spread big lie even though know false millions listen these people believe here too another terrible truth disease big lie continues this day attacks our democracy are ongoing not force baseball bats pipe bombs then certainly through quieter much more organized effort subvert democracy from bottom just big lie inspired attack january big lie continues like disease across state legislatures throughout country where are seeing most restrictive voter suppression efforts since jim crow--since jim crow--in 21st-century america turning clock way back let's abundantly clear these new anti-voter laws are books today only because their authors cited big lie cited fictitious bugaboo voter fraud are trying succeed where insurrection failed unless confront big lie unless all our part fortify strengthen our democracy political violence january risks becoming not

plan mcconnell plan--that what is--is unacceptably insufficient even offensive scorekeeping matters little game rigged know too well state legislatures are working day night undermine our democratic process from get-go empowering partisans potentially say which ballots count which not what good accurately count result compromised from start senator mcconnell's plan reform electoral count act would nothing more than codify vice president's ceremonial role counting electoral college votes effectively guaranteeing partisan state legislatures could overturn elections without fear recourse look what does look what does cynical idea idea divert attention from real issue because don't want confront real issue this cannot this should not about one party versus another voting rights have always been bipartisan--supported bush h.w supported reagan--passing this chamber with large votes from both sides aisle what always used happen until republican party was taken over donald trump not about one party versus another can't about one terrible lie against democracy itself kind lie let stand both verbally action erodes our democracy--erodes our democracy majority people--there already substantial minority who don't believe our elections are legitimate aided egged donald trump rightwing media what majority this country because these pernicious actions starts believing majority americans don't believe elections are level just ask yourself what will happen can't predict details but can predict will diminish greatness this country small even large ways cannot--this should not partisan issue about falsehood versus truth history this country have always disagreed ideology but never facts until recently such important area lying about results election acceptable instigating mob against government considered permissible encouraging political violence becomes norm will open season this grand democracy this noble experiment everything will for grabs whoever has biggest clubs sharpest spears most effective lies not believe ultimate destiny our country mob may strong but counter stronger--the roots democracy feelings american people affection love for this grand noble experiment democracy are stronger long speak out long act wellspring democracy deep even most difficult times americans have rallied risen occasion since early days our republic americans launched

march perfect our democracy never over our democracy precious sometimes fragile gift purchased those who struggled before all now must our part keep american vision going present into future somehow ways can't predict but know are true certain god's mysterious hand will guide truth right will prevail yield floor presiding officer booker senator from minnesota klobuchar thank senator schumer for your leadership your work your words today stand here look faces staff remember moment when were pushed out this chamber for security reasons remember words one staff member leigh who yelled out take boxes take boxes was talking about mahogany boxes were filled with electoral ballots because knew would destroyed were left behind remember own staff--one them here today--hearing their stories being closet hiding closet with only forks happened next door protect themselves right next doors where insurrectionists had invaded remember staff throughout this building who were marooned places faces police officers cuts their faces anguish words officer dunn who said end day had been called n-word multiple times had looked his friends collapsed rotunda said this america this america haunting words police officer police radio was heard broadcast middle whole thing there plan there plan there were many breakdowns day but biggest breakdown was breakdown our democracy some people actually felt could take law into their own hands could invade not just building but our very republic look back words speeches people gave day not only after insurrection but what was telling was what said before started think would urge people look those speeches discussion were having about this had been raging for weeks for months remember standing this very place right before closed down senate because insurrection going through facts going through facts about how president-elect biden time had more votes than any president history facts living defense secretaries had actually stood time including both donald trump's defense secretaries including people like dick cheney donald rumsfeld william cohen came together said scurrilous attacks our democracy must stop must allow for peaceful transition power then looked very end remarks ended with this right before were invaded said this friend roy blunt whom still have immense respect for what did evening friend roy blunt fellow rules committee leader many years ago found statue bust man top bookcase did research went historians and][a]ll could find out was one knew who this guy was except was cleric hence statue called unknown cleric now time our leaders this great place thought this man important enough would warrant statue for him but today one knows who senator blunt's message schoolkids senators alike visit his office when shows them statue what here more important than who are ended with this senators what matters not our futures not our short term destinies what matters our democracy's destiny because think many know people will not know who are 100 years from now 200 years from now but what will know this will know what did today how voted today more important than who are someone once said i]t republic can keep republic can keep those words ring more true now than page s58 did year ago because know haunting shrieks police day officer pinned between doors hands rioters--there were people who stood for our republic there were people who attacked our republic remember captain carneysha mendoza 19-year veteran capitol police who testified before rules committee who suffered chemical burns her face while commanding officers rotunda while struggled hold doors open who can forget officer eugene goodman who after saving senator romney from walking directly into mob ran himself take group rioters with his baton then diverted mob away from senate chamber allowing safely depart president who can forget image right there where sit dais insurrectionists rifling through papers people's desks opening their offices desks tragically five officers who reported for duty have since passed away--five officers wonder why see sad faces today many people this building who were their friends capitol police officer brian sicknick died day after attack four other officers died days months followed--capitol police officer howard liebengood metropolitan police officers jeffrey smith gunther hashida kyle defreytag many more suffered physical injuries even more sustained emotional trauma from events day also remember course officer billy evans who tragically died doing his job his post april recognizing sacrifice those heroes defend our democracy least can senator blunt led legislation with support our leaders honoring those who protected capitol january with congressional gold medal was honor stand with officers their families august president biden signed this bill into law have made many many improvements security capitol think very important for staff officers alike those who work there know want thank senator schumer for his work installing new sergeant arms karen gibson for senate have general walker over house have new police chief chief manger who did excellent job yesterday describing changes know there are many challenges ahead last but not least not have enough police officers right now fill vacancies people are working double shifts are working vacations are canceling vacations have over 400 openings experience many police departments throughout country have right now but one very important chief has committed fill those vacancies but what have done progress well have one gotten new personnel two have passed law this chamber signed into law president biden makes easier for chief call national guard case emergency have made sure there are operational plans place there were this summer when major events occur one saddest memories day was fact percent police officers asked defend this capitol were plain clothes--75 percent many cases had less protective gear than invaders capitol has changed--no more equipment going locked bus can't access with senator leahy's leadership with appropriations senator shelby's leadership have been able obtain more funding get them equipment need all those things are important but senator schumer noted other piece this our democracy itself means getting bottom what happened something happening right now with house select committee working get facts would have loved have independent commission like 9/11 commission but are doing work over house yesterday heard from attorney general garland who pledged look this every level where facts will lead those were his words accountability every level for what happened here key largest investigation have seen history america over 700 people have been charged big piece this work well--accountability senator schumer noted this also about carrying torch our democracy voting rights legislation are working right now couldn't more important because what was not accomplished with bear spray bayonets has now been passed others pass bills have seen wisconsin where bill actually passed would have allowed for only one ballot dropoff box entire city milwaukee one was vetoed governor evers but others have passed states like georgia states like texas across this country concerted effort undermine our democracy when take oath defend constitution united states matter what party are hold our democracy dear precious precious thing very fragile our hands protect just our police officers protected january when have 9,600 threats against members congress--double what has ever been past--that not small thing january continued when have election officials who have leave their posts because words election official from city philadelphia his own family was threatened their names their addresses their house put out internet katie hobbs secretary state arizona receiving voice mail saying hunter think should hunted people rural areas who are

former president told them egged them believed him meanwhile many his cronies unlike many his followers who stormed capitol have paid price for their roles must held accountable for planning promoting this travesty his case doing nothing stop assault even when appealed repeatedly his closest advisers new york times has observed our nation faces existential threat from movement openly contemptuous

common defense promote general welfare secure blessings liberty ourselves our prosperity''--that our oath our promise thank yield floor presiding officer senator from pennsylvania casey president rise many have done this day couple things--no reflect remember important for many reasons but are also here think express gratitude commendation for many who work this building staff capitol police many others who kept safe year ago today awful day will get some other issues moment but want start with just some reflections what remember about day but also what think country experienced day horror terror desecration--a day when group americans came this building stop counting electoral votes were told then-president united states page s65 know all death ensued from especially law enforcement officers something order 140 injures some them grievous permanent injuries law enforcement--all based upon violence based upon big lie deliberate falsehood started long before even election day started during course election but despite big lie--i don't want spend all today talking about that--despite big lie violence flowed from big lie near collapse our democracy despite know something order judges throughout country federal judges state judges appointed democrats republicans even some appointed former president--called out big lie rejecting arguments based upon big lie about different matters before those judges know what happened think january commission will continue put evidence record hold people accountable but think day like today want focus two issues one express gratitude mentioned before for thousands americans who work this building thousands who are not members congress who helped day everything from getting safety making sandwiches for when were safe secure room--something basic but course many americans now know after all these months have unfolded about sacrifices made many day especially law enforcement but people this building who work this building--have done for years--they too were terrorized day wasn't just members congress nation more broadly even had image--the horrible disturbing racist image--on television american walking through halls this building with confederate flag never happened before not even during american civil war had happened when talk about those who have done much here what are talking about are talking about people who suffered devastating injuries said before some them lifelong emotional toll this violence imposed upon members staff here building both during siege its aftermath almost incalculable are grateful for their service every day every day their work but especially terrible day also want thank--and can't this enough can thousand times wouldn't enough--the u.s capitol police metropolitan police department for all did protect ultimately quell violence literally protect our democracy these officers were bruised beaten were attacked with bolts bricks bats bear spray saw much well stun guns had broken bones had concussions chemical burns scars stitches what violence does human being were also subjected to--those who happened black americans law enforcement communities color--they were subjected horrific racial epithets kind language should never tolerated not only here capitol but anywhere our country some them were even attacked american flag--by flagpole with american flag what this all adds unfortunately not just mob going into building this about domestic terrorism think important day thankful many stood domestic terrorism law enforcement both offer our gratitude try inadequate mere words--on day like today bestow some measure both gratitude commendation for what did day finally president think today day for resolve determined take action legislative action best way can passing freedom vote act best thing can not only for next couple weeks but really might most important thing any work want thank senator klobuchar many others who have worked these issues not just aftermath january but for thinking about future--the future our democracy literally future whether someone will have clear pathway right vote ability vote ways many americans were able vote midst pandemic there were lot people back who said know pennsylvania had big turnout for president 2016 but turnout going way down because reelection there pandemic people won't vote people will afraid vote guess what happened went from about million votes 2016 almost 6.9 million votes almost 900,000 more people voted pennsylvania than did just years earlier--probably highest turnout more than 120 years our state just like was for nation now didn't happen our state just because people were more interested happened because had pathways way change state law allow them vote very similar what are trying enacting into law freedom vote act--being able vote early being able vote way mail-in ballot having drop box what are years old live rural area pennsylvania have rural counties way what live rural area can't get county election bureau drop off your mail-in ballot shouldn't have drop box are years old want vote what live farm what are running farm have busy life are running small business shouldn't have opportunity vote should just restricted day year day every year for general election can't get vote day then are not able vote why would back those days but apparently lot people this chamber are supporting efforts all across country--hundreds voter suppression bills reverend warnock said seems like some people don't want some people vote don't understand after had record turnout pennsylvania from 2016 because had different pathways for people vote what are trying with freedom vote act have national standards people will have chance vote way want way helpful terms their family life their work life but are point now where big lie perpetuating itself more ways than one let conclude with one thought hometown newspaper scranton times-tribune published editorial today president ask unanimous consent have printed record part remarks editorial entitled long year after 1/6 continues which dated today there being objection material was ordered printed record follows from times-tribune jan 2022 long year after 1/6/21 continues would sobering enough today look back jan 2021 attack capitol thus people united states nation's representative democracy singular event that's impossible because attack continues carries statehouses like pennsylvania's where lawmakers continue question outcome presidential election--the most transparent heavily scrutinized vote nation's history--craft bills diminish sort heavy turnout carried president joe biden victory waste public money fraudulent searches for fraud gerrymander congressional districts cause minority rule more than republican members pennsylvania legislatures endorsed disqualifying pennsylvania's electoral votes which would have disenfranchised 6.8 million pennsylvania voters preposterous claim election law had passed less than year earlier unconstitutionally had skewed election continues person disgraced politicians such republican reps dan meuser fred keller northeast central pennsylvania who supported lawsuit spawned texas aimed disenfranchise their fellow pennsylvanians then voted congress united states after mob attacked not certify duly vetted electoral college results from pennsylvania page s66 continues movement replace with partisan hacks professional election administrators who resisted pressure cook local state election results favor president donald trump continues shameless efforts many republican members congress--who sensibly ran for their lives trump-inspired rioters invaded capitol--to characterize jan insurrection anything other than what was another day infamy americans who care about future u.s democracy cannot view jan 2021 one-off date should considered same sentence other insidious attacks--dec 1941 sept 2001 though capitol insurrection was not deadly other attacks potentially more serious because came from within ongoing results are profound there doubt has emboldened totalitarians abroad challenge democratic regimes movements not coincidental russian strongman vladimir putin has amassed troops ukrainian border chinese dictator jinping crushed democracy movement hong kong increased menacing conduct toward taiwan wake insurrection just sustained action was required following 1941 2001 attacks required wake 2021 insurrection congress must pass for people act which would establish host election reforms john lewis voting rights advancement acts which would restore protections for voting supreme court foolishly has diminished weakening voting rights act 1965 will require suspension elimination filibuster senate which undoubtedly would produce political howling but filibuster mere procedural rule one chamber congress allowing any one 100 senators power diminish voting rights millions americans not how representative democracy supposed work likewise congress should update electoral count act 1887 eliminate its potential vehicle for coup select house committee investigating jan along with department justice aggressively must move hold accountable not only rioters but those who facilitated them any way some point americans might able view jan 2021 crisis u.s democracy survived but day not today casey won't read all obviously but point this editorial makes attack continues today not over not some event past are just reflecting upon important reflect remember offer gratitude commendation here what editorial says will just read short portion says t]he attack continues carries statehouses like pennsylvania's where lawmakers continue question outcome presidential election--the most transparent heavily scrutinized vote our nation's history--craft bills diminish sort heavy turnout carried joe biden victory waste public money fraudulent searches for fraud gerrymander congressional districts cause minority rule goes from there saying attack continues all this work lie about election pass voter suppression bills all across country good news not going happen are not going allow partisan minority prevent from passing

those individuals who saved many lives some whom their own while others know have already come before talked about incredible role capitol police other allies--the metropolitan police--as presiding officer knows first state police arrive scene were maryland virginia actually got here quicker than national guard but would like highlight comments today another group people who helped quell insurrection was virginia national guard group men women presiding officer have great pride both have served governors commonwealth virginia one most important roles being governor--beyond fact incredibly important title carry when are governor--is fact served during those each our years presiding officer commander chief guard one most meaningful parts recall was seeing off those guard members young old--these are folks who have day jobs lives studies work--seeing them off deployed iraq afghanistan respond aftermath hurricanes floods welcoming back these citizen soldiers way oftentimes doesn't get recognition deserve but again think back january crowds grew here capitol grounds steadily advanced their positions eventually into this building itself--and again many were here think senator from oklahoma was speaking heard glass break people shouting quick let's secure doors think all who work here our pages great members floor staff with particular recognition parliamentarian staff come racing think about those doors upstairs which are frankly pretty flimsy all remember day those moments was obvious pretty quickly were going need additional force augment capitol police metropolitan police now year ago took much too long than was needed get national guard provide assistance had point convoluted system place resulted delays getting guard capitol proud say since then congress--again under leadership our chair rules committee senator klobuchar--has passed bipartisan basis president has signed into law capitol police emergency assistance act which empowers capitol police chief request assistance guard other federal law enforcement agencies emergencies without prior approval process was used past capitol police board kind bureaucratic hurdles frankly didn't allow guard get called year ago when decision was finally made utilize national guard personnel men women from national guard maryland national guard virginia guard were literally first ones called within hours riot capitol being stormed while personnel here ground were still working secure fully regain control capitol complex men women virginia national guard were ready for deployment king assumed chair mentioned earlier those us--and see now presiding officer former governor maine had same responsibility had previous presiding officer had governors commander chief our guards know firsthand national guard each our respective states civilian force these men women who were called january were called from their jobs their studies most importantly their families were called from cities towns big cities small farming communities all across commonwealth within hours mobilized for domestic deployment our national capitol remember one guard member met who lived arlington--he was working got deployment call rushed back home pick some clothes take shower had frankly drive all way down--i think were mustering newport news point then were redeployed here capitol next morning january morning following riot first national guard personnel arrived scene support ongoing security effort protect against possibility future threats folks this room remember how uncertain immediate aftermath was men women guard arrived fully armed had been told prepare for possibility confronting heavily armed rioters protesters--not tourists heavily armed rioters protesters--and even possibility some those rioters protesters might bring bombs ieds could have been placed vicinity capitol still haven't found source those bombs were placed democratic republican national committees page s68 weeks leading inauguration after 7th before 21st even more national guard personnel poured into from across country virginia national guard continued perform critical outsized role this response with nearly 2,500 men women--close percent total guard presence dc--securing capitol grounds library congress providing quick-reaction capabilities capitol metropolitan park police adding critical communications medical logistical chaplain support want specifically highlight virginia national guard's 116th infantry brigade combat team which played leading role protecting our capitol weeks following january ibct under command col chris samulski led task force more than 7,400 airmen soldiers from different states was responsible for maintaining physical security capitol grounds leading inauguration twice during their mission here capitol had privilege meeting with virginia guard what heard time again was great mix emotion came with this deployment these women men had volunteered for duty serve united states protect our constitution but what normally expect duty ensue was protecting against our foreign enemies see friend colleague from virginia know visited with guard well many these men women had been deployed--in some cases multiple times--to iraq afghanistan many these soldiers airmen had been deployed aftermath hurricanes storms natural disasters none them not only from virginia but from any other state was mustered here had ever been deployed when frontline against people who wanted overthrow our government was not abroad but right here our nation's capital were shocked all this very building where work every day needed national guard protection truth was would spend weeks duty camped out our capitol around congressional office buildings again thank chairman rules committee when sometimes didn't get fair shake tried get pushed aside many under her leadership said these folks should not pushed out cold because somebody wants their parking space back remember their kind uncertainty were kind saying senator didn't think would ever here but also remember their pride serving part this historic mission their direct role safeguarding our democracy their presence during time all way through inauguration when there were still concerns mobs might back think helped calm capitol not just members but those who were pages point many many staff helped calm capitol our country while faced still face unprecedented challenges nation work dedication men women guard demonstrated our democracy stronger than destructive behavior any mob this important because events january were not isolated event what happened day was product big lie perpetrated former president cultivated those who wished chip away sacred values upon which our nation was founded those same individuals--those same individuals--in many instances continue stoke lie our elections are not secure are better off hands partisan officials with authority overturn results somehow those partisan officials don't like results people fueled big lie number states across country are changing laws undermine right vote free fair elections rights all americans but especially minority americans--people color young americans--are being attacked basic tenets our democracy are under siege these changes voting laws are un-american for example what happened wednesday where heard yesterday--oftentimes precincts color particularly precincts with heavy concentration african americans wait not hour minutes line wait hours line idea can't give any water food while are waiting hours line who going vote states like texas where are saying local government can overturn results local election--that not democracy despicable some people want make harder for eligible americans participate our democracy one things saw very proud commonwealth virginia dramatically expanded our voting rights this year had unprecedented turnout resulted favor one party our candidate choice didn't republican candidate because helped turn out early vote notion--i don't understand those who are trying restrict what are people afraid when more people participate consequently why need act now protect our democracy passing john lewis voting rights advancement act freedom vote act since senate has shown cannot this basic duty find senators support basic voting rights time change senate rules filibuster can't abused continue blocking vital voting rights legislation can think better way honor sacrifices were made defense our democracy last year than passing

state wisconsin republicans state legislature are willing disregard clear reality wisconsinites from across political spectrum exercised their right vote record numbers secure fair safe election instead are pushing trump's big lie gain partisan advantage curtailing voting rights putting barriers make harder vote are today fleecing taxpayers support sham partisan process under false guise election integrity undermining people's faith our elections same time are advancing redistricting proposal will double down wisconsin's unprecedented level partisan gerrymandering all while our hard-working election officials are facing threats against their lives simply for doing their jobs enough enough why senate must take pass freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act without delay regardless where live this country should have same access ballot box faith our elections are fair safe voting rights has long been bipartisan issue but unfortunately republican colleagues are obstructing from taking this incredibly important legislation obstructing from taking action stop voter suppression protect voting rights freedom vote act will counter election

insurrection uncertain terms well big lie about election drove mob desecrate this hallowed chamber must honor strengthen our democracy passing legislation puts end these ceaseless attacks voters integrity our elections yield floor presiding officer senator from colorado bennet president feel grateful have chance here join colleagues mark anniversary january thank chair rules committee senator klobuchar for her leadership all this had insurrection here year ago could have very easily turned into conflagration had not been for incredible bravery capitol police other law enforcement who were summoned capitol too late but nevertheless here national guard colleague from virginia was talking about kept this place from being burned down kept people from getting killed their lives day subsequent days because trauma were exposed suffered racial epithets nobody america should have suffer shouted halls this capitol--t shirts with most racist holocaust-denying slogans them there are people here colleague from wisconsin said who were claiming were acting like tourists really big lie too this was incredibly dangerous situation were saved not just but staff all over this capitol everybody else just heard somebody downstairs basement walking were pointing out one those pictures down there newsboys standing front capitol when were kids guy said those were great-uncles because this place people who work here--not talking about senate but people who work here who are staff whose grandparents worked here whose great-uncles who are pictures downstairs--to them this was family was attacked was assaulted behalf people who came summoned here president who claimed election had been stolen from him who was perpetrating big lie about what had happened election there shouldn't have even been surprise about results election there was little reason for suspense tragic year later still have come here say joe biden election--and did any fair study what happened day--on election day arizona 10,000 votes georgia 11,000 votes wisconsin 20,000 votes pennsylvania 80,000 votes michigan 150,000 votes every one those swing states more votes than donald trump his election against hillary clinton this wasn't some razor-thin margin this margin was bigger those states except arizona than margin donald trump had when election against hillary clinton joe biden this election million votes donald trump actually popular vote when election million votes but his election wasn't seriously contended anybody shouldn't have been because had electoral college just joe biden had electoral college still claims election was stolen even though there evidence true his own attorney general said lie his lawyers donald trump's lawyers--had been thrown out more than courtrooms state federal judges some them appointed president trump himself saying there was evidence there was fraud year later there has been another incredibly expensive audit review election--this time election georgia know what there were four people down there who were dead who voted--four people didn't actually vote were dead but people cast ballots behalf them four people out million one those cast vote for donald trump but president trump continues say there were dead people voting all over united states america associated press did review all those swing states was mentioning earlier found just looked disputed ballots--so these aren't even fraudulent ballots because haven't been identified fraudulent are just disputed ballots all these cases disputed ballots came about 1.5 percent margin any one these races other words not single one these swing states where there dispute president trump has brought would make material difference even were true what alleges which not has still doubled down big lie result colleagues have said here today there are more than 400 bills nationwide name big lie making harder for american people vote making harder for them register making harder for people vote early vote-by-mail because myth because lie slashing number polling places drop boxes texas are down one drop box per county colorado can practically cross street vote drop box this effort subvert elections cling power what happening page s70 here based massive falsehood big lie think one needs ask oneself even people who support president trump what future does stop steal movement imagine for our country what future imagine for this democracy--where every election going contested where political violence replaces ballot box where elections are decided strongmen not votes turning into russia china really what want our legacy here country want first generation americans decide just too hard our duty people who founded this country people who fought from time this country was founded until today who died for sake democracy just too hard somehow our differences are unique important are going give our shared commitment democracy favor those disagreements think need ask ourselves moment like this what owe generations americans have fought make this country more democratic more fair more free what owe 158 million americans--a record--who showed during plague this covid pandemic cast their votes for donald trump for joe biden what are owed what owe our kids our grandkids think answer very clear which stronger democracy economy works for everybody not just people very top where begin know colorado think great example where have made lot easier for people vote have one highest voter turnouts country always have say especially when senator from minnesota around are terms voter turnout minnesota but are coming for spirit should all have should trying get more people vote not fewer people vote should have vote by-mail should have early balloting have all colorado one highest turnout rates country fraud--no fraud going just finish saying should distrust politicians who can't seem people's votes with their argument just should distrust politicians who attack free press avoid accountability even though free press enshrined our constitution should recommit each other democracy let tell something president last week had another tragedy colorado another disaster pueblo co--or boulder started out this year with mass shooting grocery store some may remember basically new year's eve had massive fire ripped through neighborhoods front range colorado boulder county thousand people--a thousand houses were burned more than 30,000 people their homes sat there thinking myself was with daughters watching those fires television set how much actually need each other know there lot evidence out there those days law enforcement who got those 30,000 people out had almost literally fatalities because what did what sacrificed coloradans stepped night said can come house will put house out those 30,000 people there were fewer than 300 people shelter night reporters journalists were out there long into night reporting fire people might have some sense whether their house had been their house had been saved local county officials have worked tirelessly after flood after fire after natural disasters come together make sure build back stronger which always colorado--and even let say federal government's contribution federal emergency management agency--because there one reason should one nation under god for natural disaster like one just occurred colorado this our choice either save this democracy which believe will let going let generations americans are going indict save think will celebrate work did here just celebrate work people who came before who made our country more democratic more fair more free with yield floor presiding officer senator from maryland van hollen want thank colleague from colorado for reminding how important for come together americans protect our communities protect our country really why are all here today floor senate because year ago today witnessed violent attack this capitol

from massachusetts have worked often together these democracy issues look forward doing days ahead also want commend senator klobuchar from minnesota because has been our point person rules committee which central this whole debate think all understand what stake what colleagues have been outlining think have been very fortunate have senator klobuchar helm have worked together one issues going talk about vote mail but just want people understand how valuable has been president colleagues year ago today not far from where stand this afternoon domestic terrorists tried beat our democracy ground might have been successful were not for police officers who defended our democracy were viciously attacked beaten before anything else said view elected official need salute these officers all those who work day day out alongside them here capitol for their courage ought internally grateful insurrection january was instigated former president who wanted undo results democratic election let's also understand unfortunately inciting mob wasn't end donald trump didn't exactly walk quietly off into sunset after biden inauguration effort undermine our democracy end free fair elections america goes speak support for big lie essentially unchanged from where was year ago awful lot republicans who said after january were done with former president have cozied back him just months later only reason mob not here today donald trump didn't summon them back now view our job ensure another attack like this any other means never succeeds will have more say about those issues days ahead view protecting vote has got step one protecting democracy guiding principle for senate must while politics may guide citizen's vote should never determine whether are allowed vote act otherwise would undermine very foundations representative democracy empowering voters with system built integrity accountability system promotes participation rather than discourages system with real history bipartisanship say presiding officer colleagues kind have home state oregon oregon believes strongly right vote everybody gets ballot sent straight their home honored say was first u.s senator elected all vote-by-mail election back then was oregon republicans who were pushing expand vote-by-mail democratic governor even vetoed vote-by-mail bill 1995 right after election oregon republicans flipped back vote-by-mail was suddenly bad everything flipped few months later when friend gordon smith republican from eastern oregon became second u.s senator elected mail this point oregon voters said have just had with everybody looking for some kind partisan slant here just think vote-by-mail really terrific idea went out vote ballot measure chose make oregon's elections all vote by-mail passing with percent vote 1998 this view was culmination process started years ago with some local elections linn county small county western part our state grew grew from there election officials learned when let people vote home participation goes costs down one biggest defenders oregon's vote-at-home system was late dennis richardson was our secretary state his characterization was about conservative--a republican could get but when trump era came along people criticized our elections said there all this fraud spouting lies about late dennis richardson stood said conservative republican are wrong are wrong what are saying about oregon even wrote donald trump 2017 are confident voter fraud last november's election did not occur oregon every election now young oregonians watch their parents voting around their kitchen table real inspiration next generation make sure are committed voters voting home gives opportunity more informed there particular measure initiative race haven't researched get time look into options when are done your ballot goes into security envelope sign outside off goes for when head from our home southeast portland sellwood branch multnomah county public library drop ballot collection box head home--no long lines glitchy touchscreen systems just hassle-free voting recent analysis election law journal said all states voting easiest oregon senator klobuchar have heard colleagues back forth say who participation who all these aspects think like number other states are all kind competing for highest turnout rates get some highest country have been leader terms increasing turnout among black latino voters voter registration automatic easy trip department motor vehicles for myself--and senator klobuchar have talked about this often over years--i have been proposing legislation have universal at-home voting since 2002 what vote home act would would give every american right vote oregon way vote neighbors can will say here senate floor guarantee oregon way will nationwide hit immediately letting people vote home also best defense against some really horrendous methods suppressing vote for example what have seen over last few years with state local governments shutting polling places particularly ones serve black latino voters--what unforgivable actions these days some areas republicans are making illegal give food water people standing line vote shouldn't test physical stamina able vote nobody should have wonder will able vote step out line bathroom nobody should have sacrifice entire day participate this incredible incredible democratic system america page s77 why proposed people over long lines act called poll act bill says state governments have guarantee everybody who votes person can within minutes anybody who forced wait longer has legal action can bring sue bucks for waiting longer than minutes bucks more for every hour after free bit advice states get ready make sure people don't have wait lines one best ways make sure don't have wait lines let them vote home not just oregon way votes mail think senator klobuchar heard some our colleagues talk about their states voting mail need another example let's think about u.s armed forces most servicemembers their families vote mail every election all people who wear uniform united states can vote mail every federal election has been way for decades bottom line think time get oregon system into every nook cranny america feel way because works raises voter participation lowers cost running elections helps voters more informed safe secure are resisting safe efficient elections with higher voter turnout then are suppressing democracy america home state oregon shows way preserve america going close remarks but think will have senator klobuchar speak for all here moment but closing want touch just for moment family proud german family fled their homeland place where were deeply rooted nation's society grandfather was member parliament served berlin city council family was forced jews flee fascists who had taken over their democracy fled america last remaining beacon freedom with freedom dad chose serve our army which fought against german fascism dad

public servants journalists members military average citizens destroyed lives process but never revealed his list names any other credible evidence for his claims nonetheless senator joe mccarthy discredited defamed anyone standing his way would accuse his opponents being communists communist sympathizers publicly disagreed with him with rare notable exceptions--and one them senator margaret chase smith republican senator maine few others--no one had courage question joe mccarthy challenge his wild allegations politicians were too afraid would turn them next remained quiet absence

right change outcome our election simple declarative statement truth--that vice president cannot singlehandedly overrule will american people--is welcomed but fact drew outrage from former president

condemn trump's lunacy but need more voices filling silence need nothing less than avalanche condemnation from republicans but sadly all have gotten far are just few flurries here there republicans need speak because america doesn't extricate itself from donald trump his maga ideology could undercut our american way life this isn't partisan scuffle when former president calls for termination u.s

bipartisan effort pass congressional review act measure overturn president biden's unconstitutional federal vaccine mandate private businesses bipartisan vote majority u.s senators sent clear message these job-killing mandates are wrong have place our country's fight against covid-19 then just days after christmas president biden said something very interesting while was talking with governors about covid-19 pandemic admitted look there federal solution this gets solved state level this president biden's message states should leading effort now doesn't mean there isn't role for federal government but what have seen from biden administration progress just worsening cases horrible job-killing consequences his unconstitutional mandates private businesses want clear his unconstitutional mandates are job killers back october federal reserve reported vaccine mandates were widely cited businesses reason for low labor supply hiring retention issues was finding republican colleagues have been warning about for months before their report directly tied inflation when labor supply reduced prices families especially those low fixed incomes suffer restaurants grocery stores gas stations small businesses all have charge more heard about restaurant owner petersburg who had take certain items off menu because simply cost too much can't pass cost his customers has even seen price oil to-go boxes more than double talked operator food bank osceola county used see families each day now seeing upward families food prices have gone through roof more expensive for her get food give people hurting very time demand this reality for families small businesses all across america vaccine mandates nothing but make these problems even worse can't imagine why just when our country working get back its feet president united states would pushing policies kill jobs but exactly what doing now lockdown loving fauci president biden want double down their insane mandates are considering forcing every american who wants fly show proof vaccine before boarding airplane this just another orwellian response from biden administration radical democrats does nothing protect american people providing information about virus providing tests supporting vaccine therapy developments getting economy back track should only role federal government this pandemic congress has take stand protect american people from these page s39 communist china-style policies are meant divide why few months ago introduced prevent unconstitutional vaccine mandates for interstate commerce act bill would prevent federal agencies like department transportation department commerce from requiring proof vaccination for companies trying business across state lines importantly would block federal government from making airline passengers show proof vaccine before catching flight which exactly what fauci wants this bill also protects truckers will ensure biden administration can't ruin our supply chains even more our truckers are key fixing biden's supply chain crisis should everything can protect them president biden has continually showed his track record failed policies mandate for domestic airline passengers would only add his growing failures blame shifting saw his failed deadly withdrawal from afghanistan have seen his administration's complete failure handle crisis across southern border see every day president biden's inability fight inflation stopping reckless spending continue see his failure complete void leadership how this administration fighting covid-19 now sure democrat colleagues will say this legislation isn't needed because this exact moment there not vaccine mandate fly plane but said same thing last year when tried preemptively block vaccine mandates for private businesses claimed president has committed not know president broke promise american people deserve better than politicians who continue mislead them federal government's failures fight covid properly back-and-forth has end must end these ridiculous unconstitutional vaccine mandates focus getting our economy back track why mentioned earlier u.s senate passed congressional review act measure invalidate president biden's vaccine mandate bipartisan basis senate along with majority americans doesn't believe federal government should force people choose between taking vaccine losing their job why again demanding federal government stop trying force american people follow draconian job-killing mandates hurt families this second time have come floor try pass this bill protect rights american families businesses would like thank senators cynthia lummis ron johnson mike lee roger marshall for joining introducing this important urgently needed legislation this

reserving right object colleague right has been floor talk about this issue don't think though has all facts right just had major transportation hearing commerce committee before left for holiday recess heard from airline executives--some who had implemented their own vaccines some who had implemented other mandates systems their own others who basically responded federal government's desire say passengers would required wear masks all them said this was big success all them said this along with federal dollars went into preserving airlines allowed our economy recover better than other nations had basically when upswing transportation got point where people felt was safe travel those mechanisms themselves helped have airline sector industry could respond literally thanksgiving were percent where had been previous year colleague think would like predetermine today exactly everything are going this issue would prohibit president department transportation amtrak transportation security administration from making these decisions future now can just tell get every day read press also went gym today first thing said where your vaccination card are not letting there fact businesses--the airlines small businesses--are using this tool even though has highest explosion covid cases nation percentage right now--i understand neighborhood live there was pretty hearty new

allies about his intent weeks before election committee found trump raised hundreds millions dollars with false representations made his line donors proceeds from his fundraising have learned have been used ways believe are concerning particular committee has learned some those funds were used hire lawyers have also obtained evidence efforts provide offer employment witnesses for example one lawyer told witness witness could certain circumstances tell committee didn't recall facts when actually did recall them lawyer also did not disclose who was paying for lawyer's representation despite questions from client seeking information told her are not telling people where funding coming from right now have learned client was offered potential employment would make her financially very comfortable date her testimony approached entities were apparently linked donald trump his associates these offers were withdrawn didn't materialize reports content her testimony circulated witness believed this was effort affect her testimony are concerned these efforts may have been strategy prevent committee from finding truth throughout post-election period ex-president trump was told repeatedly his campaign advisors government officials others there was evidence support his claims election fraud even since our last hearing select committee has obtained testimony from new witnesses

accountable those domestic terrorists violent extremists who stormed capitol hunted us--lawmakers others--ransacked halls regard with much reverence defaced debased not just building but concept democracy should pursue not only prosecutions against 700 1,000 people who can held criminally responsible for defacing capitol illegally entering other acts violence but everyone who aided abetted them must held accountable matter what their rank their office matter how high facts law will urge department justice pursue them prosecute them make sure are held accountable also need fortify those institutions why passing freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act have among our priorities changing rules make possible colleagues will bring senate floor for vote coming weeks later than january those measures effort change rules enable their passage need whatever necessary pass those measures including limiting filibuster there direct through line from big lie january assault incited donald trump violent extremism domestic terrorism voter suppression overturning elections eventually destruction our democracy during peaceful transition power eventually did take place last january president biden reminded better world not something given requires hard work unity not inevitable achievable through what make possible democracy not spectator sport values norms institutions our democracy are fragile threatened now are precious depend people fighting for them times adversity truly now are time adversity what haunts think back january how close came losing our democracy how close came shattering traditions norms--much windows this building were shattered--and how few people continue believe could demagogue enable trump stage coup there forgetting what some our colleagues did there denying but have sought work together because come here are sent here for common purpose which meet needs americans especially time pandemic economic hardship this past year has truly been one hardship heartbreak for many think back day year ago need redouble our determination hold dear democratic values institutions mean elected representatives truly represent people what

it--the common purpose day when came back count vote--to make sure can come together again not just honor people who enable but also honor people america who elect yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut january murphy madam president why january why were thousands trump supporters here washington specific date january were here january because was last possible day donald trump his followers could overturn election which joe biden had just beaten sitting president soundly--81 million votes million votes gap electoral college was much bigger percentage basis 306 232 but trump his followers decided were not going just give power just because their candidate election their decision put power ahead rule law frankly totally understandable over course human existence thousands second-place finishers either through election dynamics power succession have refused bend rules most recently russia briefly flirted with democracy until vladimir putin his cronies rigged rules set him power permanently throughout history many slighted princes generals have just chosen seize power through force coercion couldn't get through standing rules wanting power willing anything get power old civilization why all those people broke into capitol year ago tomorrow were called washington president trump pressure congress state legislators vice president pence suspend rules succession void election install donald trump president even though let's not pretend anything else happened day senators cruz hawley many many other republicans were january trying get congress delay certification electors give trump more time overturn will voters rioters came capitol use violence last resort try pressure congress adopt cruz-hawley plan stormed building many them were explicit when were here day were inside building support president trump support senator cruz end day dozens were killed badly injured wasn't spontaneous random act mass violence was coordinated attempt use violence least threat violence for many void election install donald trump unelected leader united states america history has seen this play million times before but think here senate often get lulled into little bit sense complacency because last vestiges pre-trump era republican party still exist here senate senate only seven republicans voted for senators cruz hawley's attempt void joe biden's victory senator mcconnell some others here said right thing day days afterward behind closed doors many our veteran republican colleagues often whispered how awful vulgar trump rioters are how dearly support rule law but almost never those republican colleagues say those things out loud because new mainstream republican party--the trump republican party--does not believe joe biden election pick your conspiracy theory but out republicans--literally tens thousands americans--believe somehow pakistani intelligence operatives italian satellites venezuelan communists were involved secretly switching millions votes from donald trump joe biden but maybe more importantly what leads these republicans believe these wild conspiracy theories more insidious belief belief democrat wins election must definition illegitimate why this many republicans believed joe biden didn't even though have zero evidence back this claim don't need evidence because just believe democrats are evil democrats are illegitimate governance democrats just cannot allowed stand defeating democrats trump republican party more important than maintaining democracy know this because some most popular revered national republicans are calling openly for suspension democracy democracy page s48 keeps electing democrats congresswoman marjorie taylor greene called for states with republican governors disallow people from voting showed inclination support democrats our colleague senator rand paul said efforts convince people vote--if those votes resulted democrats winning--should illegal sensible senate republicans--the ones who whisper sensible things quietly here floor senate chamber--will claim marjorie taylor greene outlier fringe character but exactly opposite mainstream doesn't believe joe biden election just like out republican voters fact willing say quiet things out loud doesn't make her fringe makes her royalty best attended republican event state since election was event headlined marjorie taylor greene rand paul their ilk are republican party right now are healthy trunk tree sensible senate republicans who believe joe biden legitimate president are dead limbs bound fall off soon slight wind mainstream today's republican party believes beating joe biden other democrats just more important than preserving democracy why are methodically working clean their mistakes from couldn't declare joe biden's illegitimate because just weren't ready january what january was about attempt postpone certification electors could get ready well 2022 2024 are going ready heart this plan attempt just make whole lot harder for democrats vote eliminating voting sites democratic neighborhoods eliminating days vote--days typically democrats vote but republicans are also preparing secret weapon--a backup plan--if election night their attempts depress democratic turnout don't work out democratic candidate for governor senate president still wins this backup plan all about changing who counts votes used even republican-majority states democrats had role counting votes either through bipartisan panels through ability for cities counties choose their own election officials which often meant democratic counties had democrats charge counting votes republican counties had republicans charge counting votes this has been longstanding foundation our democracy making sure one party had monopoly vote counting both parties are engaged process there lot more incentive for both sides play safe play straight--but more republican-controlled state after state rules are being changed put republicans only republicans charge counting votes more consequently deciding which votes count trump his followers are making sure only republicans who are 100 percent loyal trump will chosen few republicans charge vote counting everybody has heard phone call from which president trump personally lobbies georgia secretary state disqualify just enough democratic votes order shift state's electors trump just want find 11,780 votes trump pleads phone call during hour-long call makes exactly clear what wants wants 11,780 more democratic votes disqualified through vague made-up claims fraud order flip election tells exactly what wants phone call votes disqualified zero basis fraud order flip election him new state laws purge straight shooters like georgia secretary state from party will make sure 2022 2024 election close enough flip republicans obstacles were place will gone now know every republican senator even few democratic senators think this scenario just outlined hyperbolic think scare tactic but why would think trump his allies aren't even trying hide what did what are doing trump election election million votes didn't care did everything his power including using violence try stay power despite fact since then has cheerled all these changes state laws any really think doing this because believes good governance clean elections course not has told words deeds over over what his goal his goal achieve power whether not actually wins election not hiding his supporters leaders republican party are now openly calling for states strip from democrats democrats only right vote right campaign for election this all happening front your eyes out open right now only we--the 100 us--have ability stop this january was just preview was what happens because trump his minions hadn't done necessary planning ahead steal election panicked brought violence upon this building may not need physical rebellion 2022 2024 because will have changed rules make sure republicans loyal trump are installed power regardless whether election none are helpless here u.s senate can pass laws take away from states power disenfranchise any voters ability put only one party charge vote counting few democratic senate colleagues think are saving senate preserving republicans right stop these reforms are wrong don't take steps right now stop trump's plan there won't senate left protect not hyperbole loser election for u.s senate gets seated member this body then our democracy effectively dead time started actually listening what trump republicans are telling over over again out loud are getting ready have made their choice have chosen power over democracy get always easier nothing hope threat will just away--just shut door box your ears cover your eyes hope for best but are u.s senate are ones are put watch are ones are supposed meet threat head-on stop yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut congressional record volume 168

anti-democratic poison donald trump's big lie all demand same solution senate must advance legislation protect our democracy safeguard right vote over coming weeks senate will thus consider legislation can pass achieve this goal democrats for months have tried bring republicans table but every single time republicans use rules senate prevent even debate voting rights past was bipartisan issue how quickly forget republican presidents--ronald reagan george bush george bush--supported voting rights when voting rights extensions came this body past passed large majorities--bipartisan resistance see from modern-day republicans beast entirely different nature maybe some them were scared trump but too many them see this way advantage get their hard-right views enacted even though public doesn't support them jaundicing our election process putting barriers way particular people--not all people--of voting people color poor people people who live big cities young people handicapped people elderly people said dear colleague earlier this week republicans continue hijack rules chamber prevent action something critical protecting our democracy then senate will debate consider changes rules before january martin luther king day page over course history senate has debated voting rights many times done what was necessary take action but rarely did our predecessors face sort malice now confronts our democracy from within one final point mean arguments from other side--they are saying federalize elections constitution federal elections can determined federal legislation what some our great post-civil war amendments were all about what history voting rights legislation has been about when state legislatures for reasons often bigoted racist said people couldn't vote for one reason another stopped them from voting congress stepped nothing new unbelievable arguments come with--just totally false totally false hold this debate ask colleagues consider this question right vote cornerstone our democracy then how can democrats permit situation which republicans can pass voter suppression laws state level with only simple majority vote but not allow u.s senate same ask democratic colleagues--my democratic colleagues this asymmetry cannot hold senate republicans continue abuse filibuster prevent this body from acting then senate must adapt senate always has robert byrd one this chamber's great traditionalists acknowledged senate rules seemed appropriate past must changed reflect changed circumstances boy boy have changed circumstances now with this abandonment voting rights republican party willingness let voters from one end country other suppressed times change circumstances evolve senate must follow suit changed circumstances when necessary are going work towards goal coming weeks downplay threat against our democracy dangerous--dangerous have seen this history forever when people try subvert democracy when use threats violence

will speaking georgia part democrats effort convince american people voting rights are under attack can justify their attempt abolish senate filibuster pass their partisan election legislation noted democrat operative once famously said should never let good crisis waste meant course crisis could give opportunity push things through might not able get done ordinary course things lesson democrats have learned well last march for example democrats used cover covid crisis pass so-called covid relief bill had very little with covid relief had lot with expanding role government providing payoffs democrat constituencies but unfortunately for democrats when comes election legislation there crisis for democrats exploit democrats have spent past year busily trying manufacture one say past year but democrats have actually been claiming there voting crisis for much longer source election bill will likely vote this week h.r 1--election legislation was first introduced democrats back 2019 back then democrats told our election system was broken needed this bill fix after all republican had last presidential election beat favored democrat candidate surely surely meant our system was trouble but then elections came along democrats presidency majority--albeit narrow majority--in both houses congress voter turnout was massive pew research center poll found percent people found easy vote--94 percent all sudden was pretty page s125 difficult for democrats claim our system was broken but still wanted pass their election legislation came with new crisis 2021 number states passed updates their voting laws partly because challenges special circumstances arose result pandemic democrats decided these commonsense mainstream updates represented unprecedented attack voting rights georgia which was one first enact voting legislation has become poster child for democrats campaign convince americans their voting rights are danger what terrible voter suppression measures are states imposing well one provision georgia law has come for lot democrat outrage its measure forbidding partisan political organizations from providing individuals with food water within 150 feet polling place yes apparently preventing partisan political organizations from providing lunch voters threatens very stability our entire democracy now nothing georgia's law prevents outside groups from providing food water individuals outside 150-foot radius georgia's law explicitly allows nonpartisan election workers opposed political groups make water available voters course pretty sure any voter can bring his her own food water but none has prevented democrats from suggesting rules about food water distribution polling places represent grave threat voting rights ironically state new york has similar provision its election law prohibiting any refreshment provision voter polling place except retail value what given less than person entity providing not identified yet don't see democrats traveling new york decry threat democracy posed new york legislature after georgia passed its voting law president biden got attacked law for supposedly ending voting early prevent working people from voting made accusation repeatedly problem there was exactly zero truth his claim fact washington post's fact checker column pointed out experts say net effect new early-voting rules was expand opportunities vote for more georgians not limit them from washington post's fact checker let just repeat e]xperts say net effect new early-voting rules was expand opportunities vote for most georgians not limit them fact checker gave president four pinocchios--a rating column reserves for whoppers''--for his false claim law was designed keep working americans from voting would also like point out not only georgia's election reform law thoroughly mainstream georgia's laws are actually more permissive some respects than voting laws some democrat states georgia offers no-excuse absentee voting democrat leader's home state--senator schumer's home state--does not fact voters democrat leader's home state actually just rejected ballot measure would have allowed no-excuse absentee voting guess democrat leader thinks those voters are trying destroy our democracy georgia also has way more days early voting than democrat leader's home state does arizona another state has come under fire from democrats for updating its election laws yet red states according democrats are states attempting suppress votes also important note georgia law was written address concerns from republican democrat voters including concerns raised stacey abrams-affiliated groups over 2018 georgia gubernatorial election there question--no question--we should make voting easy accessible but there are lot different ways states can have different requirements still all offer ample opportunities vote also think democrat friends need little perspective check there are countries where individuals would consider privilege able stand line vote free election--even someone didn't provide them with food water course one wants voters have stand long lines fact georgia's election law will make less likely have but democrats dramatic claims long line lack drop box say opposed days early voting somehow threatens right vote this country are nothing short absurd have faith americans are capable voting even without democratic party providing them with boxed lunch there election crisis this country this last election biggest turnout american history 120 years have back year 1900 find time when election turnout american election was equal exceeded what had what there partisan democrat election bill democrats have wanted pass since long before georgia legislature reformed their election laws because think will give them advantage future elections don't have take word for more than one democrat has openly admitted democrats want pass federal election takeover because think will give their party advantage next election democrats were really concerned about security our democracy integrity our elections really cared about affirming americans faith our electoral system would not seeking break senate rules pass totally--totally partisan election bill totally partisan basis partisan federal election takeover not going anything strengthen americans faith our system contrary will sow mistrust division heighten partisanship instead changing rules gain advantage next election would suggest democrat colleagues instead try coming with agenda would appeal broad majority americans--perhaps starting with plan address inflation crisis democrats have helped create would far better use their time than undermining faith our electoral system with partisan rules change partisan federal takeover elections yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll legislative clerk proceeded call roll graham president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered graham president will speak today two topics--no substance bill which guess yet known regarding voting rights which consider federal takeover state elections constant threat changing rules senate away with legislative filibuster know would say democratic colleagues this has been going for quite while constant threat senator schumer change rules pass whatever legislation you-all can come with all can say things were different when were charge had house senate white house president trump constantly urged senator mcconnell all republican side change rules senate could pass his agenda unimpeded anything came out house which was under republican control could sail right through senate with republican votes only was pretty clear democratic colleagues was not good outcome thought for country but guess for them signed letter april 2017--61 signatures republicans democrats independent letter was sent senator mcconnell who was majority leader minority leader was senator schumer time urging both leaders matter what differences have had regarding executive nominations judges should preserve minority's rights under so-called legislative filibuster page s126 apparently made perfect sense democratic colleagues senate not change accommodate donald trump his wishes was assuming statement democratic colleagues was about institution not just about trump presidency times which lived 2017 apparently was wrong--except for handful senators sinema manchin have led from front not from rear have taken your fair share criticism have opposed changing senate rules accommodate voting rights bill has been argument goes this fundamental democracy voting senate has give way this instance all can say when many were your shoes didn't make exception for piece legislation thought was critical future country would easy find exception here there everywhere point rule bends with exception now appreciate your steadfastness regard apparently read news few more democrats are becoming publicly unnerved thought changing legislative filibuster--just handful are supposed over weekend think maybe even into monday have change--rules change--but may flux now because appears handful democrats are showing some distaste for changing rules don't know why are coming out now appreciate don't think would very popular certain states change rules senate would pave way for most radical agenda lifetime don't know has got something with there newfound religion here handful rest won't forget this was republicans who signed letter leaders senate asking institution maintain legislative filibuster not because benefited personally but because thought benefited american people day make senate house are going have wild policy changes when are charge will down one road when democrats are charge will down another road there will just unnerving aspect this view think for well over century senate has prevented these wild changes means don't get what would like conservatives same people who are applauding resistance changing filibuster today were all over when were charge wanting change filibuster understand ideological people want their way don't particularly care how get most americans have more balanced approach about how legislative process should work think over time requirement get handful people from other party pass legislation particularly major legislation has served country well there are things would completely different than our democratic friends because have different views some these ideas just never make through senate every now then will come with solutions hard problems are bipartisan because have long legislative filibuster around idea changing legislative filibuster would pave way democrats have all branches government here make puerto rico state think would paves way for increasing number justices supreme court because liberals don't like current makeup think there would move abolish electoral college which would devastating for south carolina all people this body adding two more states may serve your interests but certainly dilutes power have individual state legislative filibuster stop sign most radical agenda have seen since have been here was stop sign trump agenda just fill blanks this effort senator schumer abolish legislative filibuster under guise single exception cynical think sign desperation like senator schumer have been able work with him immigration other hot-button issues--but truth matter this all started back when president bush's judicial nominees were filibustered mass led gang spearheaded senator byrd sort one icons senate make sure filibustering judges would done only extraordinary circumstances broke logjam couple good conservative judges part compromise held until longer held 2013 got call from senator schumer--i never will forget are going push for rules change when comes court appeals district court judges--i think 2013 remember reaction had senator mccain's were able when president trump became president had couple democratic--excuse me--a couple supreme court vacancies fill were all filibustered starting with gorsuch point changed rules could get some people court who think were highly qualified bottom line when comes judges ship has sailed executive appointments maybe should have been changed effect judiciary think going detrimental over time most ideological elements each conference will have large say about what kind judges put court will see change over time from right left because longer have reach across aisle put judge court apply legislation again would devastating country this body not require some form consensus when comes legislation deny minority ability require consensus voting rights itself think this most hyped manufactured issue long time this problem search of--it not problem search solution manufactured problem states under our constitution are supposed run elections state think pretty good job there are some efforts change election laws throughout country more more people vote mail think incumbent have same voter identification requirements voting mail person would easy manipulate system bottom line here this effort democratic leader basically say republicans our heart are bunch racists when comes voting reason are having this states are changing laws disenfranchise people color minorities find like incredibly offensive--i mean just beyond offensive state which percent-plus african american have robust opportunity vote all these laws are being changed implement voter integrity think are necessary times which live but bill coming before body whatever federalization election process not about enfranchising voters about enfranchising ability left take over electoral process skew their favor think almost all see way over here know republican particularly from south sort get used being called racist never pleasant but sort get used cheapest form politics very unsavory people state went through process hope have lived life convince reasonable people whatever flaws have being racist not one them clothe this exercise here some kind moral imperative don't this bill then people throughout country will their right vote because republicans end day don't want people color vote beyond offensive hope fails can get back some sense regular order around here but will end with this when shoe was other foot most didn't this your country needs page s127 right now speak support changing legislative filibuster one time for voting rights bill support end because there will end exceptions most over there have been hiding corner letting other people take arrows time for speak actually hope have vote because want know where people are whom can count whom can't understand what transactional what about body time will tell yield floor senator cornyn presiding officer senator from texas cornyn president considering way our democratic friends talk about state voting rights america easy see why some people have expressed concerns because took them face value might very worried about state voting rights our country but there more story than which will hope explain here next few minutes for example when comes alarmism about voting rights look further than democratic majority whip senator durbin from illinois who said there insidious effort suppress rights voters color senator schumer majority leader senator from new york has said right vote under attack ways have not seen generations president biden himself has said there 21st century jim crow assault right vote were take these face value accept them obviously would very concerned about state voting rights but there more story said just listen these statements would think states--the states--had just imposed literacy tests voting would think disgusting subjective determinations good moral character existed before civil rights movement had somehow sprung back life might even wonder supreme court united states has struck down voting rights act itself kelly assumed chair obviously none these things are true there simply concerted effort attempt prevent voters color any eligible voters from casting their ballots voting rights act--one most important pieces legislation our nation's history--is alive well think voting rights act has done more change our country for better than any other piece legislation can think frank facts simply don't support our democratic colleagues alarming rhetoric about state voting america this narrative widespread voter suppression nothing more than scare tactic achieve political outcome our colleagues across aisle have introduced many different versions their federal takeover state elections bill but justification seems always change first said was matter election security then voter confidence then now way remove obstacles prevented people from voting today our colleagues other side aisle claim this legislation necessary because states have passed new laws restrict voting access let's just take look what some those laws entail one those laws state texas where goal pretty simple which make voting easier make harder cheat texas already offers weeks early voting person new law didn't make any changes for weeks can show vote person before election day--hardly restriction people's access ballot this law did addition making sure people had weeks vote person early extend voting hours more than different texas counties clarify voters who were line time polls closed would still able cast their ballot doesn't sound like voter suppression but law also took some measures reduce opportunities for fraud mischief texas voting systems must now tested before election ensure there are technical difficulties sure all are familiar with occasional problem with voting machines technical difficulties need fixed make sure counts each legitimate vote did make sure voting rolls reflected only qualified voters other words voters who passed away were removed from voting rolls state like others has clarified temporary pandemic related measures were not intended permanent did take some extraordinary precautions midst covid-19 make sure people had access ballot but these are hardly--restoration status quo before covid-19 hardly example voter repression mentioned texas its expansive right cast your ballot person make sure everybody line when polls close could still cast their ballot another state has come under fire georgia matter fact attorney general united states has sued texas florida georgia under voting rights act course president biden highlighting georgia laws because visiting today doing what have never seen president before villainize state's new voting law which bizarre thing for sitting president travel state for purpose villainizing state's law doubt will mention fact georgia actually extended early voting days not example voter suppression trying restrict people's access ballot matter fact much more generous than what president biden's home state delaware has offered terms early access ballot these clearly are not examples jim crow voter suppression these are commonsense measures designed encourage people's confidence integrity voting systems make sure are both accessible secure these efforts should not villainized should applauded shouldn't twisted beyond recognition trying manipulate facts order achieve political outcome these state voting laws then are not designed restrict access ballot might wonder whether there was preexisting problem let's have look did voters actually have problem casting their ballot during last election well following election pew research center conducted poll voting experience found vast majority voters percent--94 percent--said voting was easy don't think could get percent people agree earth round anymore but here have percent voters who voted with ease this stark contrast with claimed assault voting rights have heard much about from our colleagues left despite what radical left might lead believe there nationwide assault voting rights there were every person this building would lined defend right vote not just democrats this manufactured crisis designed achieve political outcome there are plenty safeguards already place prevent discriminatory voting laws from taking effect most important which have already said voting rights act because this legislation justice department has authority take action against any state any political entity discriminates basis race color membership language-minority group this has been case for half century one--no one--wants weaken eliminate those protections unfortunately some our colleagues left have misrepresented picture voting rights america justify this partisan power grab legislation have introduced does more enhance their own power than does address voting rights these bills aren't about supporting disenfranchised voters fighting voter suppression because know there nationwide assault right vote notwithstanding what some have claimed this simply about enhancing political power democratic party want seize states constitutional authority page s128 manage their own elections use for their own benefit one most curious things about this debate are hearing from some our democratic colleagues want actually vote for nationwide one-size-fits-all standard detriment their own states voting laws pretty strange come here representing state--let's say was shoes democrats were come here say well state has passed voting laws represent state but want federal government take over voting laws suppress supersede voting laws state''--that what our democratic colleagues are asking for president biden apparently rather than changing voting laws his home state delaware wants federal government create one-size-fits-all answer voting rights america--again something inconsistent with constitution makes sense all well make matters even worse some our colleagues are even advocating blowing senate order achieve their goals because know don't have votes order close off debate now 60-vote requirement subject lot controversy but frankly makes good common sense country big diverse america really want have partisan majority writing laws affect 330 million people only have after next election next majority undo those change them some other way wouldn't want mechanism forces what might consider little unnatural which actually build consensus build bipartisanship make sure laws pass are not only adequately debated thought out but could endure beyond next election because enjoyed support bipartisan majorities what 60-vote cloture requirement really about about making sure purely partisan outcomes don't succeed forcing what believe best interest american people which force work together achieve bipartisan consensus election takeover bill may first one our democratic colleagues try pass eliminate weaken filibuster but won't last this isn't going one-and-done exercise anybody who says can carve out voting laws everything else will remain same just kidding themselves american people democrats created carve-out for election-related bills there would nothing--nothing--stopping them from resurrecting early versions election takeover bill passing them completely partisan basis previous versions this bill would have turned historically bipartisan federal election commission into partisan body would have mandated ballot harvesting seized states constitutional authority draw their own congressional districts these are types radical measures could see under what our colleagues call modest carve-out our democrat colleagues eliminated bipartisan 60-vote requirement floodgates partisan legislation would surely open last year our colleagues tried pass legislation exploits cause pay fairness send wave business trial lawyers pushed for another bill would impose crushing legal penalties those who refuse comply with woke social norms filibuster--the 60-vote bipartisan filibuster--were eliminated republicans would have way stopping these bills from becoming law doesn't stop there threat doesn't stop there think most controversial bills our democratic colleagues have proposed could add new states union--dc statehood puerto rican statehood could pack supreme court united states with liberal justices could pass laws infringe second amendment constitution right keep bear arms legalize abortion until time baby delivered third trimester could impose job-killing taxes kick-start green new deal what stake here this week far more than fate one two bills our colleagues are proposing put thumb scale benefit democratic party filibuster bipartisan 60-vote requirement eliminated our colleagues other side aisle will have unchecked power write laws affecting 330 million americans know are already willing manufacture voting rights crisis increase their own power are willing what aren't willing know not alone saying hope never find out president yield floor presiding officer majority leader schumer president will colleague from texas yield for request just request would like

not produced any evidence fraud million votes yet saying election all know what motivating our colleagues other side aisle--obeisance donald trump would guess most them know election was not stolen big lie doesn't take effect but trump has such power over republican party--such power--that what wants legislatures here senate page s129 would remind good friend from texas his fellow texans george bush george bush proudly supported extension voting rights act proudly did was bipartisan until donald trump came over opinion poisoned republican party voting rights could use little resistance donald trump see from good number republicans out country see from good number republican commentators but don't see here senate unfortunate not going yield for further question president begin remarks let begin with following figure--and will have debate later congressional bills 117th congress from u.s government publishing office res 1010 introduced house doc 117th congress session res 1010 expunging december 2019 impeachment president donald john trump house representatives march 2022 mullin submitted following resolution which was referred committee judiciary resolution expunging december 2019 impeachment president donald john trump whereas united states constitution provides house representatives shall have sole power impeachment president shall removed from office impeachment for conviction treason bribery other high crimes misdemeanors whereas december 2019 house representatives passed house resolution 755 agreeing article resolution impeaching donald john trump president united states for high crimes misdemeanors vote 230 yeas bipartisan coalition 197 nays present not voting whereas article resolution entitled abuse power alleges based vague innuendo opinion hearsay president trump solicited interference foreign government ukraine united states presidential election whereas article resolution alleges president trump sought pressure government ukraine announce two investigations first into political opponent former vice president joseph biden second into provable lies house senate democrats donald trump colluded with russia undermine 2016 presidential election whereas article resolution alleges president trump conditioned release 391 million for purpose providing vital military security assistance ukraine head state meeting white house with president ukraine upon ukrainian announcement both corruption investigation into influence-peddling biden family investigation into election interference 2016 united states presidential election had begun whereas president johnson was impeached 1868 for violating tenure office act whereas president nixon's resignation from office 1974 followed extensive provable instances criminal conduct including multiple felony crimes whereas president clinton was impeached 1998 for federal crime lying under oath deny justice fellow american whereas substantiate charge abuse power article resolution first circumstance american history which articles impeachment considered passed house representatives lack any allegation any crime less high crimes misdemeanors standard required section four article united states constitution whereas article resolution alleges president trump's actions were taken pursuit personal political benefit thus ignored injured interests nation whereas article resolution fails provide modification for definition guidance measure which qualifies personal political benefit injury interests nation whereas proper consideration whether high crimes misdemeanors were committed cannot justly take place without properly defining conduct issue particularly when such conduct must meet congress burden clear convincing evidence whereas article resolution submits indisputable proof commission abuse power subjective analysis july 2019 memorandum telephone conversation between president trump ukrainian president volodymyr oleksandrovych zelensky whereas standards set forth article resolution any action may affect election could potentially construed abuse power action taken for personal political benefit solicitation intervene election whereas all past presidential impeachments american history were based well-defined specific criminal acts not subjective accusations intent circumstances which primary allegations were not proven whereas anonymous whistleblower complaint which served impetus for december 2019 impeachment president trump was based entirely secondhand knowledge hearsay whereas both charge abuse power article charge obstruction congress article are built presumptions contrary facts evidence whereas transcript july 2019 call between president trump president zelensky showed conditionality for any official act president zelensky such announcement both corruption investigation into biden family 2016 united states presidential election interference investigation had begun whereas neither president zelensky nor his aides had any knowledge 391,000,000 ukrainian military security assistance was hold for further review whereas from beginning despite rabid impeachment fervor led house senate democrats media personalities liberal elite class both president trump president zelensky maintained there was pressure quid pro quo linkage between 391,000,000 announcement ukrainian investigations whereas 391,000,000 ukrainian military security assistance was released without ukraine announcing investigation any kind whereas president trump invited president zelensky meet with him white house three occasions without any conditions particularly condition(s any announcement(s investigation into biden family's corrupt practices influence-peddling ukraine whereas president trump president zelensky met september 2019 with ukrainian announcement(s any investigation(s into biden family's corrupt practices influence-peddling ukraine whereas skepticism ukrainian leaders high-level officials was entirely reasonable advised given ukraine's well-documented history one most corrupt nations world whereas skepticism biden family based strong evidence history corruption influence-peddling ukraine well hunter biden's role board directors burisma holdings limited entirely reasonable advised whereas witnesses called house democrats during impeachment proceedings testified burisma holdings limited has extensive history controversy ukraine whereas founder burisma holdings ukrainian oligarch mykola zlochevsky was ukraine's minister ecology natural resources from 2010 2012 allegedly granted licenses burisma holdings for development gas fields which had significant personal interest whereas hunter biden alongside well-connected democrat operative now convicted fraudster devon archer joined burisma's board directors time when company faced criticism time when joe biden then vice president united states acted president obama's primary advisor ukraine whereas defies reason assert hunter biden was all independently qualified for such position especially given his complete lack experience self-admitted long history ne'er-do-well drug addict whereas obama state department knew hunter biden's involvement ukraine was point ethical vulnerability took steps thoroughly prepare instruct united states ambassador ukraine marie yovanovitch how best answer questions thereon her june 2016 confirmation hearing before senate committee foreign relations whereas january 2018 during council foreign relations discussion then-vice president joe biden bragged about march 2016 encounter which bribed ukrainian president petro poroshenko proclaiming poroshenko united states would not release 1,000,000,000 loan guarantees unless poroshenko fired prosecutor general victor shokin who was conducting anti-corruption investigation into burisma holdings limited hunter biden extension joe biden himself whereas following his description particulars bribe joe biden gleefully celebrated success his bribe before those attendance specifically stating well son bitch shokin got fired whereas united states just acting good steward taxpayer dollars when can often does delay awarding such defense aid for various reasons most notably skepticism based historical pattern corruption particularly when historical pattern implicates bribery committed individuals highest levels american government such then-vice president joe biden whereas key widely understood aspect trump administration's foreign policy platform was scrutinize closely evaluate defense assistance programs foreign nations whereas one president trump's central campaign promises was ensure each country receives defense assistance from united states must first prove themselves worthy beneficiaries thereof whereas united states taxpayer-funded assistance foreign governments not considered entitlement welfare program which owed any one recipient nation whereas united states president enjoys broad authority direct foreign policy united states pausing united states security assistance ukraine for further scrutiny analysis for days was not not presumptive prima facie evidence misconduct quid pro quo exchange characterized congressional democrats before throughout impeachment proceedings whereas december 2019 house representatives passed house resolution 755 agreeing article resolution impeaching donald john trump president united states for high crimes misdemeanors vote 229 ayes bipartisan coalition 198 noes present not voting whereas obstruction congress allegations article not meet impeachable standard set forth section four article united states constitution whereas substantiate charge obstruction congress democrats submitted fact president trump chose assert executive privilege response partisan subpoenas issued house representatives whereas article asserts president trump's assertion executive privilege his unwillingness participate politically motivated effort unseat him further irrefutable evidence commission high crimes misdemeanors whereas house representatives has power determine executive privileges which president entitled whereas president trump took every reasonable measure ensure which transpired between white house ukraine was transparent possible lawmakers public alike whereas september 2019 after questions arose about contents phone call with president zelensky president trump chose declassify release transcript interest full transparency whereas president trump further released redacted version anonymous whistleblower complaint all americans could read for themselves whereas house democrats had ample opportunity defend their partisan subpoenas court but chose withdraw those subpoenas citing fact litigation would take too long holding themselves self imposed politically motivated deadline christmas break whereas taken whole both articles impeachment resolution well hearings investigations weeks preceding final passage full house representatives are thinly veiled desperate unsuccessful attempts grasp any statement public private based presumption hearsay might remotely resemble evidence president trump engaged quid-quo-pro with president zelensky whereas flippantly exercising one gravest most consequential powers with which house representatives charged democrats have committed sin about which founding fathers united states warned being use presidential impeachment partisan fashion settle political scores relitigate election results with which disagree this case 2016 presidential election donald trump now therefore resolved december 2019 impeachment president donald john trump expunged facts circumstances upon which articles impeachment were based did not meet burden proving commission high crimes misdemeanors set forth section four article united states constitution all congressional record volume 168 number thursday february 2022 house page h925 from congressional record online through

these are times try men's souls have heard much recent days about raid fbi mar-a-lago have continued hear from fbi agents former fbi agents republicans judiciary committee have friend jim jordan has pointed out received think complaints from people within fbi about very serious problems have had several have received personally were not included those understand senator grassley has also gotten some there systemic problem fbi christopher wray was appointed clean fbi told president trump later have asked about few your appointments wish would have asked about one because could have told great deal going back days mueller director fbi director christopher wray learned some those techniques director mueller even going back far boston tried keep two people who were innocent murder which were convicted were set fbi agents--and director mueller continued even after was clear were innocent try keep them from being released from prison then along came comey has had serious issues with truthfulness yet does great job trying play victim had one fbi agent who had been around long time say remember back 1980s 1990s fbi were completely professional someone had nonviolent background were just about doing our job would notify the--especially knew person had lawyer would notify lawyer your client needs appear being indicted has been indicted needs appear this jail certain time course person didn't arrive knew would picked but were given chance voluntarily surrender normally went very well quite professionally but what have seen arise with department justice fbi absolutely disgusting mean was law-and-order felony judge have sentenced people for felonies everything from probation death penalty know what wrestle over issue presentence reports evidence sentencing what appropriate sentences are page h7870 time 1700 expected local state federal law enforcement came before professional better not lie there would consequences there were but this fbi this doj far out control christopher wray took his appointment director--at time needed fbi cleaned up--as directive sweep everything could under rug fbi agents have told from different places country have talked know what director christopher wray keeps telling constantly nothing about being honest truthful about everything say but his big line tell protect fbi brand make clear say makes clear follow their actions making clear there somebody fbi doing something wrong better not report anyone but your supervisor not going get into some these because haven't had opportunity properly through them exclude identifying information but those complained their supervisors have seen complaints are retaliated against becomes very clear honest honorable law enforcement people working fbi least many them when christopher wray says protect fbi brand means don't dare report anybody anywhere except your supervisor way can get rid can make your life miserable can get out fbi only people who won't complain about lies dishonesty corruption because message seems pretty clear want people will help convict people want convicted whether are guilty not not going get into all complaints have been provided information but want concentrate one issue since mar-a-lago raid there fbi again jumped gun never ever before has former president had their residence raided very clear with director christopher wray attorney general merrick garland here deal supporter president trump let's after them make their lives living hell let's send message out far wide better back off supporting guy former president donald trump will come after will come after your friends instead doing what was done with people working with secretary state hillary clinton who were given immunity agreements would even include stuff like just want see your laptop here deal will make with instead getting search warrant grabbing laptop hillary clinton's assistants made deal just want look your laptop here our deal will not use anything find laptop against secretary clinton against against anybody just need see what there all are going are not going copy anything promise won't prosecute have never ever seen deal like who would make kind deal except corrupt people department justice fbi because what are law enforcement get warrant seize laptop there evidence crime there believe there then can used prosecute people instead giving them immunity agreement will not come after them all there were incredible deals made protect secretary clinton people who worked for her make sure had reason testify against their boss because typically law enforcement all over country all over world knows are going make case against somebody top whether mob whether state department wherever make case against people below say okay here are violations are looking years are looking 100 years but will make deal will only pursue this charge carries 2-year sentence will help people above work your way food chain way great prosecutions have occurred against mob organizations works same way with any organization except doj fbi chose treat conservatives chose treat all donald trump's friends people might have information against him were all treated very differently because there are two types justice justice longer wearing blindfold washington d.c from some complaints have seen used think problem was here national headquarters but apparently not just field office headquarters here because there has been much corruption spread all over country there all indignation from fbi doj about documents were held mar-a-lago now haven't talked anybody with president trump's team with president trump has been months last time talked him was just calling surprised was running for attorney general texas was very short conversation hadn't talked about any this but understand his frustration because have seen way evidence was created pursue two impeachments donald trump have seen evidence least some way fbi doj falsely convicted senator ted stevens immediately before his election think tried him weeks before his election just very little then was exonerated when one fbi agent who believed truth signed affidavit establishing there was exonerating evidence exculpatory evidence did not provide senator stevens forced witness say what had made clear was not true convicted him seems pattern these kinds things appear going different places yeah are convicting some guilty people but makes very difficult know which which when have organization plays fast loose with rules plays fast loose with truth have got people who have made complaints just like fbi agent who had conscience reported fraud prosecution ted stevens department justice fbi was run out fbi one was engaged fraud according fbi was reassigned then promoted how have national law enforcement entity keeps integrity when integrity longer key word yeah have heard comey others talk about integrity fbi stands for integrity not anymore all about preserving brand which means can't allow any information about corruption within fbi get outside will use our ability corrupt come after for filing making complaint reporting dishonesty every american has constitutional right communicate with his her whatever your pronoun your member congress right not only constitutional right those communications can privileged protected which why when william jefferson congressman william jefferson who did have 90,000 cold hard cash his freezer--and read affidavit was used get warrant search his congressional office--and there were people were saying gee there are people like gohmert are saying had right raid office well those individuals are just ignorant constitution but d.c circuit court appeals was not made clear look even though department justice case--and had problem with him being convicted appeared from affidavit holy cow this accurate didn't need raid his office fact raiding office violating privilege put their case was rock solid jeopardy remember being assistant district attorney right out law school ready pursue justice let's get bad guys always helps have somebody has been around while say wait minute think about this what are proposing get evidence may violate constitution may not but have got page h7871 rock solid case here why risk being thrown out trying make some point get some little piece evidence don't need have got enough convict don't create possible error pursuing evidence don't need just get conviction don't get into murky areas may reverse your case will get conviction will keep conviction won't reversed appeal but put case risk because all those years before--and did happen room was conference room speaker his legal team house counsel white house counsel came over doj counsel came over there was lot fury because what fbi under mueller did raiding office because past someone had warrant like search congressional office well doj knew fbi knew there privileged material there fact sure not only one who has had fbi agents provide information about wrongdoing within fbi time 1715 well when founders set these three branches government justice scalia once explained some friends from old town reason have more freedom than any country ever history--at least used have it--was because founders did not trust government made hard for any one three branches abuse people abuse their power only way department justice--that was created financed congress--the only way keep them accountable--or intel community--is make sure congress does proper oversight can't proper oversight unless are allowed have people come privately say here problem know are not going have reprisals why have whistleblower laws many are apparently using now way was done beforehand come house counsel have warrant house counsel who familiar with privilege congress keep certain things private other things not would then through everything was specified because have have warrant have state with particularity place searched things seized would through those would put aside anything was privileged then give things were not privileged matched what was warrant give doj but mueller wanted send message everybody congress democrats republicans don't care about your constitutional rights privileges are going heavy-handed going send message every single member congress don't mess with will come search your office will send message every fbi agent better not complain members congress because can raid their office can find out who are can destroy your lives well was message very clear d.c circuit court appeals said wait minute doj says okay will take stuff from congress members office will have some people won't involved prosecution work our office will through anything not privileged will ahead give prosecutors circuit court going can't same office come has somebody different makes sure secure saw fbi all these years later from basically doing same thing with mar-a-lago have presidential executive privilege have attorney-client privilege apparently doesn't mean much anymore doj but still means something those care about constitution yet set their own department through--we will decide what can claim privilege what--no don't get right what hurry through have already been through everything before court could appoint special master from what saw ted stevens case other cases can't sure stuff won't disappear look what just found out all these years later going back years fbi has covered for years employed russian fbi was colluding with russia dnc hillary clinton campaign were all colluding with russia try destroy donald trump why fbi hired danchenko why dnc clinton campaign hired christopher steele what are hearing news last day two time went before judge swore oath keep getting warrant spy trump campaign president trump knew their basis was lie committed fraud upon fisa court apparently there are people doj don't understand fisa--that word first word fisa not what apparently think stands for foreign committed fraud upon court got warrant for first time history country helped their political campaign spying political opponent even dod department defense got involved hired professor fact had someone who was whistleblower went said look there are hundreds thousands dollars being paid this professor london got nothing return for this problem what happened fired him because found where dod was helping after time candidate trump fired him still trying get his job back hasn't gotten justice yet but how can people america have any confidence department justice when think--when there are many people apparently who think okay commit fraud court even highest level doj fbi not okay yes every organization composed people who are human make mistakes but for goodness sakes when have top people who flaunt law think are above law want after somebody then are almighty god their judgment tantamount ever report them are coming after because are god-like their own minds look fisa court being abused badly know now--and i've mentioned before--but verizon order was leaked couldn't believe judge signed had judge not read fourth amendment have describe particularly place searched what's seized what government fbi doj said know what fisa court need every bit information this cell phone company has everybody american foreign--we don't care need every bit information have every single customer judge looked went okay need every bit information verizon has every single customer sure will sign where particularity where evidence any these people have committed crime--or probably committed crime have got have probable cause where was where indication there was evidence what was being seized prosecute those people for committing--there wasn't any just wanted everything everybody used fisa court get when saw going gosh mean have signed many warrants over years judge--i have turned many down wait don't have probable cause here can't just plead conclusions have assert specific facts your affidavit supports application for warrant judge can find there probable cause crime was committed probable cause believe there evidence going specify can found this specific location being abused like crazy here letter from--and this from attorney kurt siuzdak understanding former fbi agent sets out director wray under cfr part are advised anonymous employee federal bureau investigation making protected disclosure united states congress house representatives page h7872 anonymous employee reporting congress executives federal bureau investigation have been violating fbi security protocols have been implemented ensure security classified information since have been director fbi many senior executive service ses officials have been wearing their cell phones into scifs secure compartmentalized facilities like room can ensure totally free can't bugged has not been bugged there nobody with any electronic devices could hacked people can listen asked one our intelligence people one time about show saw movie where cell phone company required everybody meetings take their battery out phone does keep phone from being compromised during meeting said because even take battery out--which don't know how with apple phone--but even take battery out there another residual power your information there when put back could still get can listen can access camera can watch certainly didn't make feel very secure about things long there are phones around said other countries are really good hacking there are some are great somebody has phone meeting can listen can watch why have scif have couple scifs here capitol hill can't there--you can't even get near being scif with cell phone member congress allowed are very strict member allowed have cell phone smartwatch those kind things letter goes points out these violations have occurred scifs special compartmentalized information facilities field offices facility known anonymous employee worked several field offices anonymous employee had visibility counterterrorism counterintelligence field office executives although all fbi personnel are prohibited from bringing electronic devices into scifs fbi senior executive service personnel openly notoriously wore phones into scifs ways have made apparent were demonstrating their power authority subordinates these executives would walk into out scifs multiple times wearing their cell phones their belts never stop secure cell phone prior entering scifs when phone rang some executives would exit scif answer phone but others would start talking phone prior exiting scifs depending particular cell phone's settings apps vulnerabilities eavesdropping using cell phone's microphones may considered trivial cyber hacking exploit for advanced persistent threat hostile nation-state actors some executives wore multiple holders which would indicate were also wearing their personal cell phones scifs result fbi executives have willfully compromised security fbi scifs since your time became director potentially many years prior additionally anonymous individual reporting fbi executives who are involved preparing daily briefing materials for participating fbi headquarters daily briefings have brought classified materials their homes ensure are prepared answer questions for next day's briefings time 1730 why worse than what are accusing president trump although certain executives may have courier cards allow them transport classified materials classified materials question were certainly not properly packaged courier cards not allow fbi executives store classified material their homes anonymous employee advised although fbi investigating individuals not currently employed fbi for mishandling classified materials anonymous employees cannot recall single fbi senior executive service official who was even reprimanded for these violations unless involved incidents which classified material was found public contrast doj has prosecuted non-ses fbi employees for mishandling classified information one reason for failure hold fbi executives accountable field office security officers generally report special agents charge assistant special agents charge office fbi special agents employees not stop these notorious security violations because reporting misconduct these executives would certainly result retaliation would professional suicide please note doj oarm has determined anonymous reports serious misconduct can protected disclosures although department justice office attorney recruitment management has section subsection its procedures for fbi whistleblower reprisal claims brought pursuant c.f.r part stated not bound any case law u.s merit systems protection board u.s court appeals for federal circuit any other federal court appeals deciding whistleblower appeal from mspb have made clear are above courts above congress are above everything will what please wow are charge justice should also aware one your office general counsel attorneys advised would not accept c.f.r part disclosures because wasn't part her current caseload under standard ogc has completely insulated from receiving protected disclosures from outside attorneys thwarted federal whistleblower laws regulations well apparently because head fbi head fbi above courts above congress can what pleases saw merrick garland our attorney general issued order fbi are not contact any member congress much for constitution your constitutional rights attorney general saying can override constitution supreme court court appeals president god when comes message americans have serious problem with director who are acting like because after came out about saying there were phones especially director's deputy director's scif director sent out their media person say lie there have not been any cell phones allowed around scif then triggered number complaints people coming forward set out deputy director's denial was lie speaker may ask how much time remaining speaker pro tempore gentleman has minutes remaining gohmert needed know time because have play rules can't act like attorney general fbi director just ignore rules law here this letter again pursuant c.f.r part fbi's dodson rule are advised anonymous individual from fbi making protected disclosure goes this individual was executive who recently worked fbi headquarters person had work-related reasons for being director's deputy director's office areas 7th floor hoover building while working 7th floor scif areas individual observed numerous security violations involving presence personal electronic devices such cell phones smartwatches wireless sports bands individual recently read fbi publicly denied security violations fbi scifs specific violations deputy director abbate individual reporting this issue because fbi's denial casts doubt upon credibility fbi employees who made initial disclosure related abbate this individual advised scifed areas where director wray deputy director abbate currently worked had multiple people wearing displaying electronics are prohibited scif fact fbi has explicitly limited smart bands watches non-scif areas because devices pose such serious security threat there little more but then there another abbate last week federal bureau investigation issued categorical denial about your failure follow proper scif protocols protect national security keep mind speaker these are people who are condemning former president donald trump because weren't sure padlock said had add top locks had already was good enough frankly were president trump had seen heard about wrongdoing top fbi had seen gestapo tactics have used after nonviolent people who used have their lawyer get call saying page h7873 needs report certain time certain place would had seen news how would leak information whether cnn some other liberal media people could there when knock down door drug people out bed their underwear took them outside--the fbi didn't used now gestapo used what would because were about intimidation threats torture necessary but when somebody nonviolent criminal history are obviously not threat are going bring full swat team can drag them out bed one family reported her 18-year-old daughter was grabbed hair drug upstairs show where something was for heaven's sake what happened professionalism fbi department justice anyway this letter says also seem have decided good bureau equates good paul abbate does not fbi lied american people protect which shameful issuing absolute denial your misconduct also implicitly claimed two individuals who reported misconduct made false statements this assertion also false thinking back are certainly aware many your subordinates saw wearing phone scif now your subordinates are coming forward their reports are far more damning wray wray employees 7th floor violated national security because were all too lazy secure devices put our most precious most confidential secrets risk because his arrogance when ssa schoffstall--he special agent charge out west--emailed requesting rescind reprisals salt lake city's sac dennis rice--special agent charge wray's your replies schoffstall were deleted not read didn't want know about reprisals for doing his job protecting brand this supervisor refused allow his subordinates pressured lie refused help him was what did wrong his subordinates were being pressured sign lie under oath knew was lie wouldn't sign which would crime swear under oath something know not true were being demanded sign lie under oath wouldn't when their special agent charge schoffstall defended them said can't make agents sign statement are telling lie sure understand want those things there because need them have probable cause but are telling are not true supervisor was punished for protecting honesty integrity his field agents what director wray deputy director abbate about don't want hear about would delete didn't read because don't want know about pressure agents field lie affidavits who going investigate doj doj has little group lawyers will look into what ridiculous system need oversight this congress sure isn't going have oversight because want them keep coming with stuff after donald trump letter goes this supervisor refused allow his subordinates pressured lie refused help want understand how feels just ask media representative who issued denials about your personal violations scif because somebody told media rep out lie deny everything employees fbi joined because believe its core values are held standard every employee must truthful accountable have failed both counts have mistaken your employees loyalty fbi some misguided loyalty last week many your agents employees have advised will killed one your employees said fbi would issue one-way travel voucher off 4th floor hotel balcony how pathetic your employees have little faith can right thing would believe dissent against life-threatening proposition before issue any claim mock statement assured employees who suffered death threats from within fbi have filed protected disclosures with u.s congress begged for help but wray ignored their pleas their sac refused notify insider threat unit issue instead sac opened threat investigation field office level but refused assign investigator conduct investigation your employees have abandoned because abandoned them there nothing more can for fbi have demonstrated your lack honesty accountability please find job does not require either those traits time 1755 another letter came after denial according these people outright lie from top floor fbi individuals have advised were associated with fbi unit called defensive electronic countermeasure group which responsible for conducting electronic countermeasure sweeps various fbi facilities this individual individuals was/were involved sweep director's office deputy director's office including conference areas inside hoover building's 7th floor scifs their job check for security these places during sweep dozens electronic signals including wifi bluetooth

through government publishing office www.gpo.gov filibuster mrs capito president rise today deliver think one more important speeches will give member this body defend longstanding rules u.s senate are critical moment make mistake with slimmest majorities democrats haven't been able pass their wildly unpopular agenda are considering using nuclear option just think term nuclear option show how draconian is--to eliminate senate's 60-vote threshold for legislation are doing under guise protecting voting rights but make mistake--this power grab not about voting rights instead about advancing one party's agenda would like take look back what democrats including president biden have said issue why are changing their tune can also debunk argument given chance republicans would change rules eliminate filibuster democrats wish now finally most important going talk about how this shortsighted move would impact west virginians those whom represent here senate are ones who will ultimately hurt this reckless irresponsible change responsibility what can stop president biden atlanta today taking bully pulpit protest state's law does not like reason end filibuster even says this one those defining moments really people are going judged where were before where are after vote interesting would say because would like remind president biden where was when was senator biden what had say about eliminating filibuster this very floor 2005 said not only bad idea upsets constitutional design disservices country well senator biden couldn't agree more but not only one who has done complete 180 when comes filibuster majority leader schumer once said would doomsday for democracy''--that sounds pretty bad doomsday for democracy''--if filibuster were eliminated was right more recently has called filibuster most important distinction between house senate again couldn't agree more then from home state west virginia late senator robert byrd longtime democrat was unequivocal his defense preserving senate rules wrote 2010 senate has been last fortress minority rights freedom speech this republic for more than two centuries pray senators will pause reflect before ignoring history tradition favor political priority moment what would say today again this not about voting rights important note did have record turnout more people voted than ever before more than 158 million ballots were cast which percent increase from 2016 didn't have this voting rights legislation west virginia had thousands more people vote than voted 2016 matter fact total number ballots were cast was more than any election our history with one exception--the 1960 election president john kennedy don't believe hyperbole don't believe rhetoric don't take bait party-wide flip-flop are now seeing has nothing with voting rights instead has everything with paving way for aggressive progressive agenda democrats wish enact one arguments from other side hear all time well republicans would same thing change rules given chance guess what could have done unfortunately argument doesn't carry much weight leader mcconnell while sometimes under intense pressure this never wavered protected this institution didn't change rules legislative filibuster when didn't get our way could have but didn't again knows just president biden leader schumer know can't get what want changing rules way govern certainly wouldn't run household like way govern because ultimately hurts those who sent here represent them home state west virginia know what want want work together like saw bipartisan infrastructure bill hear this all time bipartisanship critical making good better policy senate rules are changed would relic past just passed signed into law infrastructure bill worked negotiate also passed cares act passed opioid passed great american outdoors act--bipartisan can this but change rules where only votes are needed pass legislation there will zero incentive motivation for two sides work together just bad legislative accomplishments could done undone redone done over over with just one flip senate seat policies harmful state could enacted green new deal court packing federalizing our elections way county clerks oppose legislation there would packing senate with new states defunding police attacking page s140 second amendment for law-abiding americans more don't even have imagine what democrats would would want can just look new york what just did are going allow 800,000 noncitizens vote put context state west virginia only had 794,000 voters who voted for president ramming radical policies through congress without even attempting gain consensus not what our founders envisioned not how americans want operate rest assured those willing change rules benefit themselves will again again again today supposedly voting rights tomorrow could gun control next day could open borders can only imagine asking fellow senators other side aisle don't this will come regret think but think need preserve rights minority need preserve chance for bipartisanship need preserve traditions senate destroy this tradition unfortunately country will suffer consequences thank presiding officer senator from kansas marshall president may one senate's newest members but does not mean don't understand importance filibuster this body this nation whole like senators before have observed practice from other side capitol member house have heard calls from frustrated majority eliminate for sake jamming through agenda cashing political gain would come from doing but anyone who has appreciation for our founding knows purpose filibuster indeed frustrate majority serve additional check our government drive consensus cooperation its purpose protect rights minority prevent tyranny majority--in short save from ourselves senators supporting majority leader's effort eliminate 60-vote threshold seemed once understand this too just few years ago them cosigned letter opposing any effort curtail existing rights prerogatives senators engage full robust extended debate sadly are now witnessing most blatant hypocritical policy switch have ever seen many current democrat senators president have abandoned these principles this flip-flop appears all name greed power want break filibuster can break other institutions such supreme court state-run elections rig our political system their favor because can't their own radical socialist policies without filibuster will see tax laws immigration rules more major policy down like roller coaster negatively impacting our economy creating uncertainty making impossible for long-term business planning filibuster meant force both parties work together come with long-lasting policies which will help all americans take for example voting legislation want make easier vote harder cheat--easier vote harder cheat with nancy pelosi's power grab act other radical election proposals democrats want let federal government take over our elections which unconstitutional make easier commit fraud pave way for mass ballot harvesting let felons vote take integrity out elections process prohibiting voter id--something proud say kansas requires voter identification working--and finally route taxpayer dollars toward funding political candidates may not agree with hope members this body can come together bipartisan way tackle important issue election integrity without destroying 60-vote threshold senate have shown recent weeks can work together bipartisan fashion senate voted pass annual defense authorization bill december help committee currently working through bipartisan bill help tackle future pandemics can still tackle major issues senate without abandoning our principles right extended debate for members this body has been preserved for two centuries longer than constitutional method electing senators via their home state legislature which was ended when 17th amendment was ratified dark day senators are being forced come senate floor defend 60-vote threshold would one body's darkest days senators changed rules removed our rights robust debate right our home states have equal representation this most distinguished legislative body will come back haunt them answer these partisan times not double down partisanship blow filibuster pray cooler wiser heads will prevail will maintain this important function senate otherwise our nation destined become winner-takes-all system where rights minority will never again considered our nation will suffer for yield floor presiding officer senator from north carolina tillis president rise today express opposition majority leader's plan change senate rules will open door wide for filibuster eliminated for all legislation moving forward bottom line very simple ideologues senate want turn what founding fathers called cooling saucer democracy into rubberstamp dictatorship want because can't get their way want wash away 200 years history want turn this country into banana republic where can't get your way change rules would doomsday for democracy these are strong words these are wise words but are not words are direct quotes from senator schumer back 2005 when was staunch opponent weakening filibuster because during time then-junior senator from new york his democratic colleagues were making unprecedented use filibuster derail president george bush's judicial nominees majority leader one point profoundly admitted y]es are blocking judges filibuster part hallowed process around here founding fathers saying senate cooling saucer but things have certainly changed two decades later president biden majority leader their democratic allies were intent ending filibuster second democrats senate last january majority leader's latest attempt force carve-out filibuster for what claims will just for one piece legislation but knows where leads full elimination filibuster sooner rather than later thought friend senior senator from west virginia put perfectly last week said problem with carve-outs end eating whole bird there such thing carve-out when comes filibuster all know will talk little bit about later but for more than century filibuster has served safeguard for our republic has prevented one party from ramming through ideological agenda when party controls both white house congress without filibuster both far left far right would have free rein ram through extreme ideological agendas divisive partisan proposals could become law with only simple majority with both parties regularly trading control congress laws can just easily overturned replaced promoting kind chaotic confusing policymaking see some european parliaments requiring votes end debate senate filibuster promotes stability necessitates bipartisan compromise pass legislation something need more not less page s141 saw firsthand when was proud participant passage bipartisan infrastructure bill way this chamber needs work why when president trump demanded think some times republicans should eliminate filibuster 2017 senators joined together letter making clear would not let happen thirty-two were democrats were republicans was one them even though received fair share pushback from side aisle back north carolina was proud sign letter 2017 would proud sign letter today unfortunately this modest display political courage has not been reciprocated many friends other side aisle twenty-seven senators who signed letter are still senate twenty-six them are now supporting full elimination filibuster what changed nothing except party power democrats staunchly defended used filibuster when donald trump was president unprecedented level but democrats are suddenly against filibuster now joe biden president many democratic colleagues are practicing situational principles putting their own party's short-term interests ahead what know are best long-term interests for senate nation doesn't get more politically cynical than president biden served senate for years was known strong defender institution including filibuster this very chamber years ago senator biden declared defending filibuster was about defending compromise moderation noted his speech was one most important would ever give but now favors destroying compromise moderation institution had long cherished all for sake political expediency for next months until republicans take back house most likely senate noted earlier majority leader also shares partisan double standard with president dear colleague letter just earlier this month wrote senate democrats must urge public variety different ways impress upon their senators importance acting reforming senate rules becomes prerequisite for action save our democracy senate rule change refers carving out filibuster order pass one far left's priorities voting bill many members colleagues have talked about today but 2018 then-senate minority leader struck different tone said legislative filibuster most important distinction between senate house without vote threshold for legislation senate becomes majoritarian institution like house senator would like see happen what difference between today only few short years ago again party power this same pattern situational principles also applies majority whip went national television when donald trump was president warn eliminating filibuster would end senate was originally devised senator durbin but less than years later after democrats control white house senate majority whip has much different take recently declared filibuster making mockery american democracy made statement after his fellow democrats used filibuster recordbreaking 328 times between 2019 when president trump was office level hypocrisy audacious even washington standards know democrats have been pushing back this claim claiming are not trying end filibuster assure this one-time deal will only apply this one bill would refer them newton's third law physics for every action there equal opposite action most definitely applies senate rules well 2013 senate democrats invoked nuclear option end vote cloture requirement judicial executive nominees other than supreme court all republicans even handful democrats including senior senator from west virginia pleaded with democrats not minority leader mcconnell warned democrats time you'll regret this might regret even sooner than think but did anyway indeed there was reaction four years later republicans controlled senate used nuclear option finish what our democratic colleagues started executive calendar ended 60-vote requirement for supreme court nominees there clear precedent what happens when change senate rules partisan basis for political expediency produces long term consequences believe both sides will ultimately regret democrats invoked nuclear option get more district judges but doing paved path for justice gorsuch justice kavanaugh justice barrett who now sit supreme court today what think now democrats nuke filibuster for just one bill senate rule change majority leader pushing really proxy vote for ending legislative filibuster altogether turning senate into house full stop ask democratic colleagues consider this when president trump called for ending filibuster large majority republican senators stood preserve bipartisanship protect respect this institution now roles are reversed president biden majority leader are demanding give them your vote weaken filibuster can ultimately ended democratic colleagues who signed very same letter did difficult circumstances ask will stand for principles stood for just few years ago respect defend this institution presiding officer senator from utah romney president prepared some remarks give this evening but had occasion watch president biden spoke georgia just few minutes ago said quite number things simply weren't true also accused number good principled colleagues senate having sinister even racist inclinations charged voting against his bill allies with bull connor george wallace jefferson davis--so much for unifying country working across aisle more troubling however said goal some republicans turn will voters into mere suggestion president biden goes down same tragic road taken president trump casting doubt reliability american elections this sad sad day expected more president biden who came into office with stated goal bringing country together now our country has defied odds for democratic republic has survived thrived for over 200 years character american people deserves most credit for but close behind are our vital institutions over last several years many recoiled foundational american institutions have been repeatedly demeaned judiciary was charged with racial bias press was called enemy people justice intelligence agencies were belittled public health agencies were dismissed even our election system was accused being rigged u.s senate one our vital democratic institutions power given minority senate resulting requirement for political consensus are among senate's defining features note federal government empowerment minority established through only one institution senate majority decides house majority decides supreme court president course majority one only senate does minority restrain power majority minority should afforded such political power critical element this institution page s142 for law pass senate must appeal senators both parties this virtually assures bill did not originate from extreme wing either one thus best represents interests broadest swath americans senate's minority empowerment has meant america's policies inevitably tack towards center senator biden previously affirmed its core filibuster not about stopping nominee bill about compromise moderation consider how different senate would without filibuster whenever one party replaced other majority tax spending priorities would change safety net programs would change national security policy could change cultural issues would careen from one extreme other--creating uncertainty unpredictability for families for employers for our friends abroad need marshal votes requires compromise middle ground empowers minority has helped keep centered nation fostering stability predictability are essential for investments people capital future abandoning principle minority empowerment would fundamentally change distinct essential role u.s senate but today's democrats now with barest majorities 50-50 senate conveniently ignore their own impassioned defense filibuster when were minority let clear those who claim filibuster racist know better for president obama make this absurd charge after himself made vigorous extensive defense filibuster just few years ago both jarring deeply disappointing after all don't recall single claim from democrats employing filibuster hundreds times over last several years when were minority was any way racist over course life have found when presented with matter personal advantage would require abandoning principles human mind goes work overtime rationalize taking advantage only few months ago some senate democratic colleagues rationalized senate couldn't function therefore had get rid 60-vote rule but then senate functioned quite well when passed infrastructure bill armed services legislation bill innovation few months later some these colleagues argued order raise debt ceiling 60-vote rule has then with bipartisan cooperation senate raised debt ceiling now democrats latest rationalization their partisan new election law must passed but democrats have filed these voting bills numerous times over numerous years always without seeking republican involvement drafting them anytime legislation crafted sponsored exclusively one party obviously unserious partisan effort let note two more truths country sharply divided right now despite truth spoken number good people party most republicans believe donald trump's lie election was fraudulent stolen democrats almost half country can imagine anger would ignited see democrats alone rewrite with republican involvement whatsoever voting laws country want see division anger democrats are heading down right road there also reasonable chance republicans will both houses congress donald trump himself could once again elected president 2024 have democrats thought what would mean for them for democrat minority have power whatsoever finally president offer this thought how absurd claim save democracy party represents barely

pressure every level government from local election workers his own vice president hoping public servants would give pressure help him steal election actually today will tell story how pressure campaign also targeted federal agency charged with enforcement our laws department justice have already covered part trump's effort heard attorney general bill barr tell committee about baseless claims trump wanted justice department investigate barr viewed those claims nonsense today will hear from jeffrey rosen person trump appointed run justice department after attorney general barr resigned will hear from other senior justice department officials also together these public servants resisted trump's effort misuse justice department part his plan hold onto power will show trump's demands department investigate baseless claims election fraud continued into january 2021 but donald trump didn't just want justice department investigate wanted justice department help legitimize his lies baselessly call election corrupt appoint special counsel investigate alleged election fraud send letter six state legislatures urging them consider altering election results when these other efforts failed donald trump sought replace rosen acting attorney general with lawyer who believed would inappropriately put full weight justice department behind effort overturn election let's think about what means wherever live united states there probably local government executive--a mayor county commissioner there also official responsible for enforcing laws--a district attorney local prosecutor imagine your mayor reelection bid but instead conceding race picked phone called district attorney said want say this election was stolen want tell board elections not certify results essentially what donald trump was trying with election for president united states was brazen attempt use justice department advance president's personal political agenda today colleague from illinois kinzinger our witnesses will walk through select committee's findings these matters but first will recognize our distinguished vice chair cheney wyoming for any opening statement would care offer vice chair cheney thank very much chairman this point our committee has just begun show america evidence have gathered there much more come both our hearings our report but would like take just moment put everything have seen context have already seen how president trump falsely declared victory november how his team launched fraudulent media campaign persuaded tens millions americans election was stolen from him donald trump intentionally ran false ads television social media featuring allegations his advisors his justice department repeatedly told him were untrue have also seen how donald trump launched fraudulent fundraising campaign raised hundreds millions dollars--again--based those same false election fraud allegations have seen how president trump his allies corruptly attempted pressure vice president pence refuse count lawful electoral votes obstruct congress's proceedings january 6th how provoked violent mob pursue vice president others our capitol have seen how president oversaw personally participated effort multiple states vilify threaten pressure election officials use false allegations pressure state legislators change outcome election have seen how president trump worked with directed republican national committee others organize effort create fake electoral slates later transmit those materially false documents federal officials--again part his planning for january 6th have seen how president trump persuaded tens thousands his supporters travel washington for january 6th will see far more detail how president's rally march capitol were organized choreographed can tell these efforts were not some minor hoc enterprise concocted overnight each required planning coordination some required significant funding all them were overseen president trump much more information will presented soon regarding president's statements actions january 6th today chairman thompson indicated turn yet another element president's effort overturn election this one involving department justice key focus our hearing today will draft letter our witnesses here today refused sign this letter was written jeff clark with another department justice lawyer ken klukowski letter was sent leadership georgia state legislature other versions letter were intended for other states neither clark nor klukowski had any evidence widespread election fraud but were quite aware what trump wanted department jeff clark met privately with president trump others white house agreed assist president without telling senior leadership department who oversaw him will see this letter claims u.s department justice's investigations have identified significant concerns may have impacted outcome election multiple states including state georgia fact donald trump knew this was lie department justice had already informed president united states repeatedly its investigations had found fraud sufficient overturn results election letter also said this light these developments department recommends georgia general assembly should convene special session consider approving new slate electors indicates separate fake slate electors supporting donald trump has already been transmitted washington for those who have been watching these hearings language this draft justice department letter will sound very familiar text similar what have seen from john eastman rudy giuliani both whom were coordinating with president trump overturn election when one our witnesses today donoghue first saw this draft letter wrote this this would grave step for department take could have tremendous constitutional political social ramifications for country this committee agrees had this letter been released official department justice letterhead would have falsely informed all americans including those who might inclined come washington january 6th president trump's election fraud allegations were likely very real here another observation about this letter look signature line was written jeff clark klukowski not just for clark's signature but also for our witnesses today jeff rosen richard donoghue when became clear neither rosen nor donoghue would sign this letter president trump's plan necessarily changed will hear today donald trump offered clark job acting attorney general replacing rosen with understanding clark would send this letter georgia other states take other actions president requested one other point millions americans have seen testimony attorney general barr before this committee one point his deposition former attorney general was asked why authorized department justice investigate fraud election all why not just follow regular course action let investigations occur much later time after january 6th here what said attorney general barr felt responsible thing was be--to position have view whether not there was fraud frankly think fact put myself position could say had looked this didn't think there was fraud was really important moving things forward i--i sort-of shudder think what situation would have been the--if position department was we're not even looking this until after biden's office i'm not sure would have had transition all vice chair cheney want thank each our witnesses before today for your role addressing rebutting false allegations fraud root january 6th thank for standing for constitution for rule law course not all public officials behaved honorable way our witnesses did close today's hearing will see video testimony three members donald trump's white house staff will identify certain members congress who contacted white house after january 6th seek presidential pardons for their conduct thank chairman yield back chairman thompson without objection chair recognizes gentleman from illinois kinzinger for opening statement kinzinger thank thank chairman thank our witnesses for being here would like start with personal story may 2009 returned from service iraq announced intention run for congress big reason decided run for congress was motivation ensure freedom democracy were defended overseas remember making commitment--out loud few times heart repeatedly even today--that are going ask americans willing die service our country leaders must least willing sacrifice our political careers when integrity our oath requires after all losing job nothing compared losing your life within halls power face president commitment can easily forgotten presidential pressure can really hard resist today will focus few officials who stood firm against president trump's political pressure campaign when president tried misuse department install loyalist its helm these brave officials refused threatened resign were willing sacrifice their careers for good our country department justice unique executive branch president oversees department justice yet president's personal partisan interests must not shape dictate department's actions president cannot must not use department serve his own personal interest must not use its people his political bidding especially when what wants them subvert democracy president cannot pervert justice nor law maintain his power justice must both fact law blind critical our whole system self-governance during this hearing will hear time time again about president's request investigate claims widespread fraud our witnesses--mr rosen donoghue engel--stood firm face overbearing political pressure because understood their oath was constitution not personal political interests president president his allies became keenly aware with legal challenges exhausted electoral votes certified their only hope would last-ditch scheme prevent congress from certifying thus throwing entire system into constitutional chaos president wanted department sow doubt legitimacy election empower his followers members congress take action department could just lend its credibility conspiracies people would have justification needed spread big lie president trump ultimately wanted department justice say election was corrupt leave rest republican congressmen will hear today department's top leadership refused not surprisingly president trump

with president where raised false claim after false claim with rosen how did respond what called stream allegations donoghue december 27th conversation was mind escalation earlier conversations former acting indicated there were lot communications preceded got later month december president's entreaties became more urgent became more adamant weren't doing our job needed step our job had this arsenal allegations wanted rely felt conversation was incumbent upon make very clear president what our investigations had revealed had concluded based actual investigations actual witness interviews actual reviews documents these allegations simply had merit wanted try cut through noise because was clear there were lot people whispering his ear feeding him these conspiracy theories allegations felt being very blunt conversation might help make clear president these allegations were simply not true went through them--in what for was 90-minute conversation what for former acting was hour conversation president went through them went piece piece say that's false not true correct him really serial fashion moved from one theory another kinzinger can give example one two those theories donoghue one was very clear point was antrim county asog report mentioned earlier allied security operations group released this report said percent error rate there was fact antrim county hand recount had nothing with department department did not request was pursuant litigation brought other parties but there was hand recount were able compare hand recount what machines had reported for ballots were actually counted machine more than 15,000 there was error ballot did quick calculation came with 0063 percent error rate which well within tolerance made very clear president because was fixated asog report december 15th conversation fact our investigation revealed error rate was 0063 percent president example what people are telling not true cannot should not relying was one very explicit one think see reflected notes went through series others truck driver who claimed have moved entire tractor trailer ballots from new york pennsylvania was also incorrect did investigation with fbi interviewed witnesses front end back end trailer's transit from new york pennsylvania looked loading manifests interviewed witnesses including course driver knew wasn't true whether driver believed not was never clear but was just not true was another one tried educate president there were series others mostly swing states course wanted talk great deal about georgia state farm arena video which believed for various reasons was said fraud staring right face kinzinger were any allegations brought found credible did find any them credible donoghue kinzinger during this conversation did take handwritten notes directly quoting president donoghue did make clear attorney general rosen called government cell phone said had been phone with president for some time president had lot these allegations was better versed what department had done just because had closer contact with investigations asked get call course agreed begin taking notes only because outset president made allegation had not heard had heard many these things knew many them were investigated but when president least when came conversation when began speaking brought allegation was completely unaware course concerned simply reached out grabbed notepad off wife's nightstand pen started jotting down had with allegation more than 200,000 votes were certified state pennsylvania were not actually cast sometimes president would say was 205 sometimes would say was 250 but had not heard this before wanted get allegation down clearly could look into appropriate why started taking those notes then conversation continued just continued take notes kinzinger let's take look notes could right now can see screen actually quote president trump asking where's doj just like heard him say his first television interview how did respond donoghue both acting tried explain president this occasion several other occasions justice department has very important very specific but very limited role these elections states run their elections are not quality control for states are obviously interested have mission relates criminal conduct relation federal elections also have related civil rights responsibilities have important role but bottom line was state ran their election such way was defective state congress correct not for justice department step certainly understood president layman not understanding why justice department didn't have least civil role step bring suit behalf american people tried explain him american people not constitute client for united states justice department one only client united states justice department u.s government u.s government does not have standing were repeatedly told our internal teams--olc led steve engel well office solicitor general researched gave thorough clear opinions simply did not have standing tried explain president numerous occasions kinzinger let's take look another one your notes also noted rosen said trump doj can't won't snap its fingers change outcome election how did president respond sir donoghue responded very quickly said essentially that's not what i'm asking what i'm just asking just say was corrupt leave rest republican congressmen kinzinger let's now put notes where quote president were speaking said president said just say election was corrupt leave rest republican congressmen donoghue direct quote from president trump correct donoghue exact quote from president yes kinzinger next note shows president kept pressing even though had been told there was evidence fraud did president keep saying department was obligated tell people this was illegal corrupt election donoghue also exact quote from president yes kinzinger let just clear did department find any evidence conclude there was anything illegal corrupt about election donoghue there were isolated instances fraud none them came close calling into question outcome election any individual state kinzinger how would describe president's demeanor during call donoghue was more agitated than was december 15th president throughout all these meetings telephone conversations was adamant had were not doing our job but did escalate over time until ultimately meeting january 3rd which was sort-of most extreme meetings conversations kinzinger want make sure don't gloss this over just say was corrupt leave rest president wanted top justice department officials declare election was corrupt even though knew there was absolutely evidence support statement president didn't care about actually investigating facts just wanted department justice put its stamp approval lies who was going help him well jeff clark rosen christmas eve your first official day acting attorney general president trump called what did want

passing made what regarded peculiar reference don't remember exact quote but was something about did know jeff clark did know who was something like told him did then conversation just moved but when

anybody clark meaning jeffrey clark doj given election-related responsibilities giuliani mean beyond president george correct giuliani well beyond president recall saying people somebody should put charge justice department who isn't frightened what's going done their reputation because justice department was filled with people like kinzinger should put somebody not frightened what going done

house late december early january described top aide mark meadows cassidy hutchinson george was your understanding representative perry was pushing for specific person take over department hutchinson

after fact know this not appropriate but was contrite said had been inadvertent would not happen again anyone asked him such meeting would notify rich donoghue kinzinger there policy governs who can have contact directly with white house rosen yes across many administrations for long period time there policy particularly with regard criminal investigations restricts both white house end justice department end those more sensitive issues highest ranks for criminal matters policy for long time has been only attorney general deputy attorney general from doj side can have conversations about criminal matters with white house attorney general deputy attorney general can authorize someone for specific item with their permission but idea make sure top rung justice department knows about thing control make sure only appropriate things are done kinzinger engel from your perspective why important have policy like rosen just discussed engel well critical department justice conducts its criminal investigations free from either reality any appearance political interference people can get trouble people white house are speaking with people department why--the purpose these policies keep these communications infrequent highest levels possible just make sure people who are less careful about who don't really understand these implications such clark don't run afoul those contact policies kinzinger thank select committee conducted informal interview with white house counsel pat cipollone his deputy pat philbin about their contact with clark though neither has yet agreed sit for transcribed videotaped interviews but pat cipollone told select committee intervened when heard clark was meeting with president about legal matters without his knowledge which was strictly against white house policy cipollone philbin like rosen told clark stand down didn't same day acting attorney general rosen told clark stop talking white house representative perry was urging chief

december 27th who told him call donoghue understanding president did outset call congressman perry told was calling behest president kinzinger what did want talk about donoghue wanted talk about pennsylvania particular gave some background about know why particular doesn't trust fbi why american people don't necessarily trust fbi then went into some allegations specific pennsylvania which included amongst others this allegation secretary state had certified more votes than were actually cast kinzinger did direct local u.s attorney's office investigate claim donoghue perry said had great deal information investigations had been done there was some sort forensic-type report would helpful didn't know congressman perry had never heard him before this conversation but said sir you've got something think relevant what justice department's mission should feel free send did was route from new york washington got looked iphone obviously couldn't read whole thing transit like but looked get feel for what was then forwarded united states attorney for western district pennsylvania kinzinger did get back what did conclude donoghue scott brady looked was western district pennsylvania u.s attorney took him couple days but got back relatively short order with pretty clear explanation for why there was foundation for concern secretary state had not certified more votes than were actually cast difference between 5.25 was actually certified secretary state million was public-facing website was information website was incomplete because counties had not uploaded their data kinzinger credibility claim donoghue there was zero right kinzinger during call did scott perry mention clark what did say about him donoghue did mentioned clark said something effect think jeff clark great think kind guy who could get there something about this stuff this was coming heels president having mentioned clark afternoon call earlier day kinzinger would like yield gentlewoman from wyoming vice chair cheney vice chair cheney thank very much kinzinger thank gentleman for yielding discussed earlier center clark's plan undo president trump's election was letter donoghue december 28th clark emailed rosen draft letter wanted sign send georgia state officials testified this could have grave constitutional consequences donoghue can tell what meant donoghue well had read both email attached letter twice make sure really understood what was proposing because was extreme had hard time getting head around initially but read did understand for what intended had sit down sort-of compose what thought was appropriate response actually initially went next door acting ag's office but was not there were both email knew would both have probably very similar reaction was not his office returned office sat down draft response because thought was very important give prompt response rejecting this out hand response explained number reasons this not department's role suggest dictate state legislatures how should select their electors but more importantly this was not based fact this was actually contrary facts developed department investigations over last several weeks months responded for department insert itself into political process this way think would have had grave consequences for country may very well have spiraled into constitutional crisis wanted make sure understood gravity situation because didn't seem really appreciate vice chair cheney what was clark's reaction when sent this email him donoghue didn't respond directly email but met shortly after after sent email acting returned went his office had just read had very similar reaction was exasperated told had told one his administrative assistants get jeff clark here want him talk face face about this three then had meeting probably around 1800 night deputy attorney general's conference room vice chair cheney one things said clark what are doing nothing less than united states justice department meddling outcome presidential election assume conveyed him well your meeting evening donoghue yes those very words was very contentious meeting but yes was said amongst other things vice chair cheney despite this contentious meeting your strong reaction letter did clark continue push his concept coming days donoghue did yes had subsequent meetings conversations acting probably had more contact with him than did but between 28th 2nd when had another person meeting clearly continued move down this path began calling witnesses apparently conducting investigations his own got briefing from dni about purported foreign intelligence interference thought perhaps once was explained him there was basis for part his concern would retreat but instead doubled down said well okay there foreign interference still think there are enough allegations out there should ahead send this letter which shocked even more than initial one because would think after couple days looking this like would have come same conclusion was completely unfounded vice chair cheney when learned had been calling witnesses conducting investigations his own did confront him donoghue yes vice chair cheney what was his reaction donoghue got very defensive know said there were series conversations through week certainly remember very specifically conversation meeting january 2nd got even more confrontational but was defensive know similar his earlier reaction when said this nothing less than justice department meddling election his reaction was think lot people have meddled this election kind-of clung then spewed out some these theories some which had heard from president but others which were floating around internet media just kept insisting department needed act needed send those letters vice chair cheney committee has also learned clark was working with another attorney department named ken klukowski who drafted this letter georgia with clark klukowski had arrived department december 15th with just days left until inauguration was specifically assigned work under jeff clark klukowski also worked with john eastman who showed our hearing last week was one primary architects president trump's scheme overturn election georgia letter have been discussing specifically talks about some eastman's theories including purpose special session department recommends would for general assembly determine whether election failed make proper valid choice between candidates such general assembly could take whatever action necessary ensure one slates electors cast december 14th will accepted congress january 6th committee has also learned relationship between eastman klukowski persisted after klukowski joined justice department let's take look email recommending klukowski eastman brief vice president pence his staff other recipients this email included chief staff congressman louie gohmert email says stated last week believe vice president his staff would benefit greatly from briefing john ken also mentioned want make sure don't overexpose ken given his new position this email suggests klukowski was simultaneously working with jeffrey clark draft proposed letter georgia officials overturn their certified election working with eastman help pressure vice president overturn election want thank all our witnesses for being here today for answering our questions about this letter other issues asked clark some same questions have asked here how answered wood did discuss this draft letter georgia officials with president united states clark fifth executive privilege again just restated for abundance caution wood okay look again draft letter first paragraph second sentence says department will update are able investigatory progress but this time have identified significant concerns may have impacted outcome election multiple states including state georgia isn't fact contrary what attorney general barr had said december clark fifth vice chair cheney chairman yield back kinzinger chairman reserve chairman thompson pursuant order committee today chair declares committee recess for period approximately minutes accordingly 4:08 p.m committee recessed until 4:20 p.m when was called order chairman chairman thompson chair recognizes gentleman from illinois kinzinger thank chairman chairman around time clark was pushing for department send georgia letter president his supporters were pressuring justice department take other actions change outcome election engel were head office legal counsel can first off explain your role what engel sure one attorney general's most important responsibilities provide legal advice president executive branch practical matter given responsibilities attorney general assistant attorney general for office legal counsel exercises job day-to-day basis addition head olc often functions general counsel essentially attorney general often chief legal adviser well white house executive branch more broadly kinzinger given role can kind-of describe your relationship with president engel well connection with role olc over course tenure there there were number instances which folks white house would seek bring provide legal advice president sometimes discussing legal options could pursued among various policy--to reach various policy objectives sometimes advise president course action had been discussing was not legally available kinzinger want ask about two things president asked department first reflected this email are going put screen president sent draft lawsuit filed department supreme court wanted rosen cipollone specifically review department opposed filing see screen here talking points actually drafted stated there legal basis bring this lawsuit anyone who thinks otherwise simply doesn't know law much less supreme court why was this department's position engel well mean think memo sort-of speaks this but essentially this was draft lawsuit apparently was prepared people outside department would styled brought united states acting solicitor general original jurisdiction matter supreme court was meritless lawsuit was not something department could would bring know somebody obviously prepared handed president forwarded for our review but memo explains why department justice donoghue said earlier doesn't have any standing bring such lawsuit lawsuit would have been untimely states had chosen their electors electors had been certified had cast their votes had been sent washington neither georgia nor any other states december 28th whenever this was was position change those votes essentially election had happened only thing hadn't happened was formal counting votes obviously person who drafted this lawsuit didn't really understand view know law and/or how supreme court works department justice was just not something were going acting attorney general asked prepare memo with talking points could explain our reasons when spoke with president about this kinzinger would say was unusual request engel certainly request department file lawsuit from--drafted outside lawyers--was certainly unusual request kinzinger there was another issue were asked look into mid-december did white house ask attorney general barr consider whether special counsel could appointed look into election fraud issues engel yes mean think president was probably vocal time believed special counsel was something should considered look into election fraud there specific know request where attorney general sought legal advice middle december kinzinger what was your conclusion what conclusion did reach engel this request was whether attorney general could appoint special counsel state attorney general conduct investigation mean legal matter under federal law attorney general actually has fairly wide discretion delegate prosecutorial authority including state prosecutors which happens assist department know not uncommonly obviously state attorney general exercising prosecutorial authority behalf department justice would fairly uncommon when looked issue what saw actually state law--the state was louisiana--that state law precluded louisiana attorney general from accepting any position any official position behalf u.s government answered question was not legally available kinzinger during your time department was there ever any basis appoint special counsel investigate president trump's election fraud claims engel well neither attorney general barr nor acting attorney general rosen did appoint special counsel would appoint special counsel when department--when there basis for investigation department essentially has conflict interest important get someone who independent outside department handle such investigation neither attorney general barr nor acting attorney general rosen ever believed was appropriate necessary this case kinzinger fact attorney general barr had already told president there was need for special counsel actually stated publicly will see here video from december 21st attorney general barr extent there's investigation think it's being handled responsibly professionally currently within the--the department this point have not seen reason appoint special counsel have plan before leave kinzinger remember december 21st was same day president trump met with republican members white house strategize about how overturn election while his attorney general out telling public again there was widespread evidence election fraud yet days later have president trump tweeting again publicly pressuring department appoint special counsel said after seeing massive voter fraud presidential election disagree with anyone thinks strong fast fair special counsel not needed immediately this was most corrupt election history our country must closely examined select committee's investigation revealed president trump went far promise job special counsel now discredited former trump campaign lawyer sidney powell late-night meeting december 18th powell know on--on friday had asked special counsel address election issues collect evidence was extremely frustrated with lack would call law enforcement any government agencies are supposed act protect rule law our republic kinzinger let's think here what would special counsel with only days until election certification wasn't investigate anything investigation led special counsel would just create illusion legitimacy provide fake cover for those who would want object including those who stormed capitol january 6th all president trump's plans for justice department were being rebuffed rosen donoghue engel others president became desperate entering into new year with january 6th fast approaching president trump rushed back early from mar-a-lago december 31st called emergency meeting with department's leadership here donoghue describing last-minute meeting held white house new year's eve donoghue president was little more agitated than had been meeting--in meeting 15th discussed variety election matters did say this sounds like kind thing would warrant appointment special counsel there was point which president said something about why don't guys seize machines kinzinger rosen president asked seize voting machines from state governments what was your response request rosen had seen nothing improper with regard voting machines told him real experts had been dhs had briefed had looked there was nothing wrong with voting machines was not something was appropriate kinzinger there would factual basis seize machines rosen don't think there was legal authority either kinzinger donoghue can explain what president did after was told justice department would not seize voting machines donoghue president was very agitated acting attorney general's response extent machines technology was being discussed acting attorney general said dhs department homeland security has expertise machines certifying them making sure states were operating them properly since dhs had been mentioned president yelled out his secretary get ken cuccinelli phone did very short order cuccinelli was phone was dhs time was speaker phone president essentially said ken sitting here with acting attorney general just told your job seize machines are not doing your job cuccinelli responded kinzinger rosen did ever tell president department homeland security could seize voting machines rosen certainly not kinzinger donoghue during this meeting did president tell would remove rosen because weren't declaring there was election fraud donoghue toward end meeting president again was getting very agitated said people tell should just get rid both should just remove make change leadership put jeff clark maybe something will finally get done responded think had earlier december 27th call president should have leadership want but understand united states justice department functions facts evidence law those are not going change can have whatever leadership want but department's position not going change kinzinger president's white house counsel pat cipollone was also present remember what his position was donoghue pat was very supportive pat cipollone throughout these conversations was extremely supportive justice department was consistent think had impossible job point but did well always sided with justice department these discussions kinzinger let's pause for second new year's eve president trump talking about seizing voting machines making same demands had already been shot down former attorney general barr least three occasions rosen donoghue multiple other occasions claim after claim knocked down but president didn't care next day chief staff mark meadows sent flurry emails rosen asking department look into new set allegations are going put those emails here screen here see three requests made january 1st one email request from meadows rosen send jeff clark fulton county what did with this request rosen well really nothing certainly didn't send clark fulton county but email was first corroboration had seen of--mr clark had told point president was considering making change

support his conspiracy theories shown here told donoghue december 27th call guys may not following internet way president trump's efforts this point had failed stonewalled rosen donoghue president trump had only one option needed make clark acting attorney general rosen during january 2nd meeting with clark did confront him again about his contact with president can describe rosen this point clark had told president had asked him consider whether would willing replace supposedly time table monday 4th had told clark thought was making colossal error judgment but also hoped persuade him more rational understood what had understood there not factual basis for fraud assertions are being made this meeting donoghue met with clark guess hopes were disappointed clark continued express view thought there was fraud even though had not been participant department's review was dissatisfied knew what were doing but had acknowledged had had further--i don't know was meeting phone calls what--but further discussion with president despite having week earlier said wouldn't did got invitation would let rich donoghue know had--it was contentious meeting where were chastising him was insubordinate was out line had not honored his own representations what would raised again thought letter should out were not receptive kinzinger did tell president had offered him job acting attorney general rosen was day later 2nd said president had asked him let him know would willing take subsequently told that--on sunday 3rd--he told time line had moved president had offered him job was accepting kinzinger let ask about what was your reaction rosen well one hand wasn't going accept being fired subordinate wanted talk president directly with regard to--the reason for wanted try convince president not down wrong path clark seemed advocating wasn't about there are only days left administration point would have been perfectly content have either gentleman left right replace anybody wanted but did not want for department justice put posture where would doing things were not consistent with truth were not consistent with its own appropriate role were not consistent with constitution did four things soon clark left office sunday 3rd called mark meadows said need see president right away was agreeable set meeting for 6:15 sunday about hours away called pat cipollone white house counsel told him what was going said would into white house make sure was meeting would supporting justice department's position had been doing consistently called steve engel who was--i was department was sunday but there had been some reasons needed there engel called home asked him would come meeting which did proved quite helpful then asked rich donoghue pat hovakimian who had previously been chief staff get department's senior leadership call let them know what was going which did then eric herschmann called tell was going meeting would supporting department justice position well knew meeting was course would have number people supportive department justice's approach not supportive clark's approach kinzinger did clark ask continue stay department rosen sunday meeting when told would replacing said had asked see alone because usually had met with donoghue because thought would appropriate light what was happening least offer could stay his deputy thought was preposterous told him was nonsensical there universe where was going stay support someone else doing things were not consistent with what thought should done didn't accept offer can put way kinzinger during meeting did clark ask sign georgia letter rosen was saturday meeting january 2nd donoghue had with him again raised with both wanted both sign letter actually kinzinger meeting did clark say would turn down president's offer reversed your position signed letter rosen yes kinzinger did clark--so still refused sign send letter take rosen right think donoghue were both very

leaving department was sunday afternoon was there civilian clothes both were expected have meeting some other work but had expectation going white house day kinzinger let's ask prior oval office meeting did set conference call with senior leadership department tell about call donoghue yes obviously was bit scramble afternoon prepare for oval office meeting had discussed several occasions acting attorney general whether should expand circle people who knew what was going was very important steve engel know why reached out steve december 28th because rosen were removed from seat president did not immediately appoint someone else serve attorney general just function department's change succession engel would seat wanted make sure knew what was going should occur three knew also brought pat hovakimian four knew but one else aside from jeff clark course knew what was going until late sunday afternoon chose keep close hold because didn't want create concern panic justice department leadership but this point asked acting what else can help prepare for this meeting oval office said pat should get aags phone time let them know what going let's find out what may there change leadership because will help inform conversation oval office pat hovakimian subsequently set meeting got most not all but most aags phone very quickly explained them what situation was told them don't need answer from right now don't need answer this phone call but have answer need next few minutes call email text whatever know what would jeff clark put charge department immediately eric dreiband who was aag civil rights division said don't need think about there way staying then other aags began chime turn all essentially said would leave would resign masse president made change department leadership kinzinger incredible would like look assistant attorney generals screen can pull have their pictures did every assistant attorney general spoke said agree resign donoghue makan delrahim was not call only because had some difficulty reaching him but yes other people screen were call all without hesitation said would resign kinzinger part select committee's investigation found while rosen donoghue engel were preparing for their meeting white house jeff clark president were constant communication beginning a.m white house call logs obtained committee show 4:19 p.m january 3rd white house had already begun referring clark acting attorney general far white house was concerned clark was already top justice department two hours later doj leadership arrived white house select committee interviewed every person who was inside room during this sunday evening oval office meeting cipollone told committee was unmistakably angry during meeting along with eric herschmann donoghue forcefully challenged clark produce evidence his election fraud theories rosen can describe how meeting started rosen yes after some preliminaries--so we--mr meadows had ushered all then left cipollone did some introductions after some preliminaries president turned said well one thing know rosen aren't going anything don't even agree with claims election fraud this other guy least might something then said well president are right not going allow justice department anything try overturn election true but reason for because what consistent with facts law what required under constitution right answer good thing for country therefore submit right thing for president kicked off another hours discussion which everyone room was one way another making different points but supportive approach for justice department critical clark kinzinger some point donoghue comes room can explain what led him coming room rosen forgot about initially part think because was underdressed had not arranged--we had not yet told president was going come in--the white house had list who would there did include engel white house counsel deputy white house counsel herschmann went then told president maybe minutes into meeting something forget how far donoghue was outside said well bring him then donoghue came joined meeting kinzinger donoghue enter room can set scene for describe tone walked into donoghue yes but could just back one moment congressman because put pictures screen aags just want make clear one aags who was not screen was john demers john was national security division aag john was call but prefaced call saying john need stay place national security too important need minimize disruption whether resign entirely obviously will respect your decision either way but asking please stay place did don't want leave impression was not willing resign because think was kinzinger great thank for donoghue with regard entering oval office was sitting hallway administrative assistant passed asked are supposed this meeting with president said simply here case questions come other people don't have answer walked away then came back probably seconds later said president wants meeting proceeded into oval office took probably two three steps stopped because was said not exactly properly attired was wearing jeans muddy boots army t-shirt never would arrive oval office this way said president apologize sorry didn't know was going here said just come come come went attempted take seat one couches are behind chairs arrayed front president's desk said are going here everyone kind-of laughed moved chairs little bit someone from white house counsel's office picked spare chair put directly front president took seat kinzinger was there discussion about clark can kind-of enlighten some what discussion was donoghue yes conversation this point had moved beyond specific allegations whether was state farm arena antrim county pennsylvania whatever had discussed those repeatedly was backdrop conversation but conversation this point was really about whether president should remove jeff rosen replace him with jeff clark everyone room think understood meant letter would out was focus was about 2\1/2\-hour meeting after entered there were discussions about pros cons doing early president said what have was actually good opening because said president have great deal began explain him what had what country had what department had this was not anyone's best interest conversation went for some time everyone essentially chimed with their own thoughts all which were consistent about how damaging this would country department administration him personally some point conversation turned whether jeff clark was even qualified competent run justice department which mind clearly was not was heated conversation thought was useful point out president jeff clark simply didn't have skills ability experience run department said president are talking about putting man seat who has never tried criminal case who has never conducted criminal investigation telling going take charge department 115,000 employees including entire fbi turn place dime conduct nationwide criminal investigations will produce results matter days impossible absurd not going happen going fail has never been front trial jury grand jury has never even been chris wray's office said one point walk into chris wray's office would know how get there got there would even know who are really think fbi going suddenly start following your orders not going happen not competent point which clark tried defend himself saying well have been involved very significant civil environmental litigation have argued many appeals appellate courts things nature then pointed out yes was environmental lawyer didn't think was appropriate background running united states justice department kinzinger did anybody there support clark donoghue one kinzinger rosen was was going replace what was your view about president's plan appoint clark rosen well alluded earlier issue really wasn't about was--it would have been fine said have had rich donoghue replace would have said great get days vacation something but issue was use justice department just important justice department adhere facts law what there what our constitutional role was justice department gets out role supposed play really bad for our country don't know simpler way say when damage our fundamental institutions not easy repair them thought this was really important issue--to try make sure justice department was able stay right course kinzinger donoghue did eventually tell president mass resignations would occur installed clark what consequences would donoghue yes this was line with president saying what have along those lines said suppose this suppose replace him jeff rosen with him jeff clark what would said president would resign immediately not working minute for this guy who had just declared was completely incompetent president immediately turned engel said steve wouldn't resign would said absolutely would president leave choice then said are not only ones one cares resign steve fine doesn't matter but telling what going happen are going your entire department leadership every single aag will walk out your entire department leadership will walk out within hours don't know what happens after don't know what united states attorneys are going have u.s attorneys districts across country guess would many them would have resigned would then have led resignations across department washington said president within hours could have hundreds hundreds resignations leadership your entire justice department because your actions what going say about kinzinger wow engel what was--can describe what your reaction was engel yes think when president--my recollection when president turned said steve wouldn't leave would said president have been with through four attorneys general including two acting attorneys general but couldn't part this then other thing said was know look all anyone going sort-of think about when see this--no one going read this letter all anyone going think went through two attorneys general weeks until found environmental guy sign this thing story not going department justice has found massive corruption would have changed results election going disaster jeff clark think point pat cipollone said yes this murder-suicide pact this letter donoghue would note too congressman was this part conversation where steve pointed out jeff clark would left leading graveyard comment clearly had impact president leadership will gone jeff clark will left leading graveyard engel again premise that--which donoghue had said--but clark could come take over department justice something different was just absurd premise all was doing clark putting himself forward was blowing himself president were have gone course know would have been grievous error for president well kinzinger cipollone white house counsel told committee engel's response had noticeable impact president this was turning point conversation donoghue toward end this meeting did president ask what was going happen clark donoghue did when finally got would say last minutes meeting president's decision was apparent announced jeff clark tried scrape his way back asked president reconsider president doubled down said have made decision are not going then turned said what happens him now meaning clark understood clark reported didn't initially understand question said president said are going fire him said don't have authority fire him senate-confirmed assistant attorney general said well who has authority fire him said only sir said well not going fire him said all right well then should all back work kinzinger did get call from president later night donoghue did don't know probably minutes later something like kinzinger what was about donoghue president this point--we left white house reconvened department left department was back apartment cell phone rang was president had information about truck supposedly full shredded ballots georgia was custody ice agent whose name had told him ice was part department homeland security hadn't heard about this department homeland security needed our assistance course would provide but was really dhs make call their agent was involved said fine understand can just make sure ken meaning ken cuccinelli knows about this said fine would pass along him eventually contacted ken cuccinelli later evening said this what president told guys have anything think should brought our attention let know said thank was kinzinger cipollone left meeting convinced president would not appoint clark but didn't think president had actually accepted truth about election sure enough all same debunked theories appeared his speech ellipse days later president trump state arizona over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast non-citizens 11,600 more ballots than votes were counted more than there were actual voters see wisconsin corrupt democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal unmanned unsecured drop boxes which collected minimum 91,000 unlawful votes kinzinger donoghue rosen engel others stopped president trump's efforts least temporarily yet message president trump his republican allies

vacancy left legendary justice william brennan president bush appoints recent first circuit nominee named david souter who had spent most his career new hampshire state government time republicans thought souter's short time federal bench was asset without long paper trail there was less chance souter's nomination would down flames like robert bork's had but souter wasn't conservative rightwing hoped for indeed could down-right moderate their disappointment adopted new mantra more souters when rumors got around george bush might nominate his white house counsel alberto gonzales court was not seen rightwing enough scheme panicked mantra became gonzales spanish for david souter john paul stevens was another rightwing disappointment more souters mantra was joined more stevenses with these disappointments rightwing donors their federalist society accolades vowed better groom vet future candidates scouring republican nominees records for maximum adherence scheme orthodoxy well once

circuit court judge who observed his colleagues taking cases issuing rulings seemed have clear intent sending signal strained write decisions were dressed impress were his word auditioning''--auditioning for federalist society gatekeepers how exactly does this auditioning work there recipe one have got understand what matters big donors guns unbridled campaign spending corporate political power shrinking so-called administrative state rightwing social issues two fly solo can actually help alone write opinions extreme stand out donors take notice three course where can deliver goods case allows score for big donor interest take three justices who knew this recipe well were trio nominated donald trump circuit court judge neil gorsuch became darling rightwing donor elites for his commitment page s1183 dismantling this so-called administrative state deployed radical legal theories cooked propagated scheme's legal theory hothouse where developed schemes kind reverse-engineering them give victories cases one instance gorsuch even wrote two opinions for same case one majority opinion his colleagues joined other out-there solo opinion displaying his scheme bona fides gorsuch also displayed his fervor for what called religious freedom which usually translates dismantling separation between church state which another scheme favorite justice amy coney barrett knew how audition too one case barrett's seventh circuit court appeals declined hear challenge indiana law women's right choose barrett bucked majority stakeout eyebrow-raising position right joining dissent aimed directly supreme court abortion precedent guns judge barrett authored opinion second amendment case called kanter barr would have given felon back his gun because his felony wasn't violent constitutional scholars jaws hit floor one adam winkler second amendment expert ucla law school told new yorker opinion was amy coney barrett's audition tape for supreme court was her audition tape because her view second amendment was outside mainstream would appeal federalist society course biggest auditioner all was brett kavanaugh circuit kavanaugh did much auditioning hard know where begin issued opinions abortion guns administrative state campaign finance more was not concerned with building consensus wanted make point here washington post editor ruth marcus her book kavanaugh his more liberal appeals court colleagues found him affable but unyielding would engage but rarely ever change his mind displayed propensity for filing separate concurrences dissents actions some colleagues took judicial grandstanding more point effort position himself for supreme court seat auditioning--in fact kavanaugh dissented more each year bench than any his circuit colleagues whether republican democratic appointees kavanaugh made clear would team court kavanaugh pumped major questions doctrine--one hothouse legal theories pushed far right says courts should ignore agency's authority solve problem court thinks problem too big big regulated companies love having regulatory agencies hobbled this was catnip for scheme donors majority case panned kavanaugh's major questions idea which hadn't even been raised parties but kavanaugh wasn't out votes from his colleagues wasn't out justice case was firing auditioning flare for scheme operatives donors see from miles around like barrett kavanaugh did his own publicity spoke 52--count them 52--federalist society events over his career almost couldn't keep him out wasn't only one seeking audience with federalist society donor elite after trump's election people trump's short list spoke 3-day federalist society panel dedicated remembering justice scalia almost all others were hanging out mingling crowd was judicial beauty pageant with some real beauties kavanaugh had little problem wasn't trump's first list potential supreme court picks wasn't second list either but all eager auditioning got him onto

cheney what was mark's reaction--mr meadows reaction this list weapons people had crowd hutchinson when tony went talk mark morning mark was sitting his couch his phone which something typical remember tony just got right into like sir just want let know informed him like this how many people have outside mags right now these are weapons are known have it's possible listed more weapons off just don't recall gave him brief but inconcise explanation but also fairly--fairly thorough remember distinctly mark not looking from his phone all right remember tony finishing his explanation taking few seconds for mark say something point almost said mark did hear him then mark chimed was like all right anything else still looking down his phone tony looked looked tony tony said sir have any questions was like what are hearing looked tony was like sir just told about what was happening down rally then was like yeah yeah know then looked said have talked president tony said yes sir aware too then said all right good vice chair cheney asked tony tony had informed president hutchinson yes vice chair cheney tony said yes had vice chair cheney hutchinson your understanding ornato told president about weapons rally morning january 6th hutchinson what ornato relayed vice chair cheney here's how characterized meadows's general response when people raised concerns about what could happen january 6th george time days leading 6th there were lots public reports about how things might bad 6th even potential for violence i'm hearing correctly what stands out meadows did not share those concerns least didn't act those concerns hutchinson did not act those concerns would accurate george but other people raised them him like this exchange mention ornato pulled him aside hutchinson that's correct vice chair cheney hutchinson are going show now exchange texts between deputy chief staff ornato these text messages were exchanged while were ellipse one text write but crowd looks good from vantage point long get shot was f'ing furious text messages also stress president trump kept mentioning otr off-the-record movement are going come back ask about minute but could tell first all who text who was furious hutchinson text was referring was president vice chair cheney why was furious hutchinson hutchinson was furious because wanted arena had ellipse maxed out capacity for all attendees advance team had relayed him mags were free flowing everybody who had wanted come had already come but still was angry about extra space wanted more people come vice chair cheney did rally presidential motorcade hutchinson was there yes motorcade vice chair cheney were backstage with president other members his staff family hutchinson was vice chair cheney told hutchinson about particular comments heard while were tent area hutchinson when were off-stage announce area tent behind stage was very concerned about shot meaning photograph would get because rally space wasn't full one reasons which i've previously stated was because wanted full for people not feel excluded because had come far watch him rally felt mags were fault for not letting everybody but another leading reason likely primary reason because wanted full was angry weren't letting people through mags with weapons--what secret service deems weapons are--are weapons hutchinson but when were off-stage announce tent was part conversation--i was vicinity conversation where overheard president say something effect know don't f'ing care have weapons they're not here hurt take f'ing mags away let people can march capitol from here let people take f'ing mags away vice chair cheney just clear hutchinson your understanding president wanted take mags away said armed individuals were not there hurt him hutchinson that's fair assessment vice chair cheney issue wasn't with amount space available official rally area only but instead people did not want have through mags let's listen portion what told about hutchinson this particular instance wasn't capacity our space was mags people didn't want come through that's what tony had been trying relay him morning know it's not issues encounter campaign have enough space sir don't want come right now have weapons don't want confiscated secret service they're fine mall can see mall want march straight capitol from mall vice chair cheney president apparently wanted all attendees inside official rally space repeatedly said are not here hurt vice chair cheney and--and just clear was told again in--in conversation--or was told again conversation people couldn't come through mags because had weapons hutchinson correct vice chair cheney people--and his response was say can march capitol from--from ellipse hutchinson something effect take f'ing mags away they're not here hurt let them let people can march capitol after rally over can march from can march from ellipse take f'ing mags away then can march capitol vice chair cheney hutchinson what saw when those clips were playing were photos provided national archives showing president offstage tent before his speech ellipse were some those photos well just want confirm when heard president say people with weapons weren't there hurt him wanted secret service remove magnetometers hutchinson correct photos displayed were standing toward front tent with tvs really close where would walk out onto stage these conversations happened minutes before took stage morning vice chair cheney let's reflect for moment president trump was aware number individuals crowd had weapons were wearing body armor here what president trump instructed crowd president trump we're gonna walk down--and i'll there with we're gonna walk down--we're gonna walk down--anyone want but think right here--we're gonna walk down capitol vice chair cheney crowd know did proceed capitol soon became apparent secret service including secret service teams crowd along with white house staff security capitol would not sufficient hutchinson i'd had two three phone conversations with ornato when were ellipse then had four men meadows detail with between those individuals then few other bodies ground just secret service doing advance were getting notifications through their radios ornato one phone conversation had called said make sure chief knows are getting close capitol are having trouble stacking bodies vice chair cheney hutchinson when said were having trouble stacking bodies did mean law enforcement capitol needed more people defend capitol from rioters hutchinson was becoming clear secret service capitol police officers were getting overrun security barricades outside capitol building were having short--they were short people defend building against rioters vice chair cheney mentioned ornato was conveying this because wanted tell meadows did tell meadows people were getting closer capitol capitol police was having difficulty hutchinson after had conversation with meadows mr.--after had conversation with ornato went have discussion with meadows was secure vehicle time making call when had gone over car went open door let him know had immediately shut don't know who was speaking with wasn't something regularly did especially when would over give him information was bit taken aback but didn't think much thinking was--i would able have conversation with him few moments later vice chair cheney were able have conversation few moments later hutchinson probably about minutes later there was another period between where shut door again then when finally got out vehicle had conversation but point there was backlog information should have been made aware vice chair cheney opened door control car meadows pulled shut hutchinson correct vice chair cheney did two times hutchinson correct vice chair cheney when finally were able give meadows information about violence capitol what was his reaction hutchinson almost had lack reaction remember him saying all right something effect how much longer does president have left his speech vice chair cheney again much this information about potential for violence was known learned about onset violence early enough for president trump take steps prevent could for example have urged crowd ellipse not march capitol could have condemned violence immediately once began could have taken multiple other steps but will see today later hearings president trump had something else mind one other question this point hutchinson were aware concerns white house counsel pat cipollone eric herschmann had about language president trump used his ellipse speech hutchinson there were many discussions morning 6th about rhetoric speech day conversations with herschmann had relayed would foolish include language had been included president's request which had lines along effect fight for trump are going march capitol will there with fight for fight for what are doing fight for movement things about vice president time too both herschmann white house counsel's office were urging speechwriters not include language for legal concerns also for optics what could portray president wanting day vice chair cheney just heard president say would with his supporters marched capitol even though did not end going certainly wanted some have questioned whether president trump genuinely planned come here capitol january 6th his book mark meadows falsely wrote after president gave his speech january 6th told meadows was speaking metaphorically about walk capitol will see donald trump was not speaking metaphorically heard earlier rudy giuliani told hutchinson trump planned travel capitol january 6th want pause for just moment ask hutchinson explain some terminology will hear today have heard use two different terms describe plans for president's movement capitol anywhere else one those scheduled movement another one otr could describe for what each those mean hutchinson scheduled presidential movement his official schedule notified press wide range staff will traveling with him known public known secret service are able coordinate movement days advance off-the-record movement confined knowledge very very small group advisors staff typically very small group staff would travel with him mostly are just included national security package can pull off-the-record movement together less than hour way kind-of circumvent having release press goal not have have many security parameters put place ahead time make moment happen vice chair cheney thank let's turn back now president's plans travel capitol january 6th know white house counsel pat cipollone was concerned about legal implications such trip agreed with secret service shouldn't happen hutchinson did have any conversations with pat cipollone about his concerns about president going capitol january 6th hutchinson january 3rd cipollone had approached knowing mark had raised prospect going capitol january 6th cipollone had brief private conversation where said need make sure this doesn't happen this would legally terrible idea for have serious legal concerns capitol day then urged continue relaying meadows because understanding cipollone thought meadows was indeed pushing this along with president vice chair cheney understand hutchinson also spoke cipollone morning 6th were about rally ellipse cipollone said something like make sure movement capitol does not happen correct hutchinson correct saw cipollone right before walked out onto west exec morning cipollone said something effect please make sure don't capitol cassidy keep touch with are going get charged with every crime imaginable make movement happen vice chair cheney remember which crimes cipollone was concerned with hutchinson days leading 6th had conversations about potentially obstructing justice defrauding electoral count vice chair cheney let's hear about some those concerns mentioned earlier one your interviews with hutchinson having private conversation with pat late afternoon 3rd 4th pat was concerned would look like were obstructing justice obstructing electoral college count--and apologize for probably not being very vice chair cheney that's fine hutchinson continuing clear with legal terms here--but would look like were obstructing what was happening capitol hill was also worried would look like were inciting riot encouraging riot erupt capitol--at capitol vice chair cheney fact days before january 6th january 6th itself president trump expressed multiple white house aides wanted capitol after his speech here what various white house aides have told committee about president's desire capitol george did president tell this wanted speak capitol luna correct yes tonolli during meeting dining room did idea president proceeding walking capitol 6th after his speech come max miller walking capitol tonolli driving capitol max miller came tonolli how did come what was discussed max miller brought said want down capitol george what about him marching capitol 6th luna yes george tell about luna it's kind-of general thing mean get into specifics i--i was aware desire president potentially march the--or--or accompany rally attendees capitol george when did first hear about this idea president accompanying rally attendees capitol 6th luna this was 6th this was during the--after finished his remarks vice chair cheney when president said would going capitol during his speech ellipse secret service scrambled find way for him know this from witnesses secret service also from messages among staff president's national security council nsc staff were monitoring situation real time can see how situation evolved following chat log committee has obtained can see nsc staff believed mogul--the president--was going capitol are finding best route now from these chats also know staff learned attack capitol real time when president trump left ellipse stage 1:10 staff knew rioters had invaded inaugural stage capitol police were calling for all available officers respond when republican leader kevin mccarthy heard president say was going capitol called hutchinson isn't right hutchinson correct vice chair cheney this text message told tony ornato mccarthy just called too guys think are coming office tell about call day with leader mccarthy during president's speech ellipse hutchinson was still tent behind stage when are behind stage can't really hear what going front when mccarthy called with this information answered call sounded rushed but also frustrated angry was confused because didn't know what president had just said then explained president just said marching capitol told this whole week aren't coming here why would lie said not lying wasn't lying sir i--we are not going capitol said well just said stage cassidy figure out don't come here said will run traps this now will shoot text can assure are not coming capitol have already made decision pressed little bit more believing but think frustrated president had said ended phone conversation after called ornato reconfirm weren't going capitol and--which also our text messages sent mccarthy another text telling him affirmative were not going capitol didn't respond after vice chair cheney understand hutchinson plans for president come capitol had included discussions some point about what president would when

capitol were chanting for vice president hung vice chair cheney let pause here this point rioters chanted hang mike pence president united states donald trump said mike deserves those rioters were not doing anything wrong this sentiment has expressed other times well interview with abc news correspondent jonathan karl president trump was asked about supporters chanting hang mike pence last year instead condemning them former president defended them karl continuing saying hang mike pence president trump because it's--it's common sense jon it's common sense you're supposed protect--how can you--if know vote fraudulent right how can pass fraudulent vote congress vice chair cheney president trump's view rioters were not doing anything wrong mike deserved helps understand why president did not ask rioters leave capitol for multiple hours fact put this tweet out 2:24 p.m hutchinson recall seeing this tweet which president said vice president did not have courage what needed done hutchinson vice chair cheney hutchinson what was your reaction when saw this tweet hutchinson staffer works always represent administration best ability showcase good things had done for country remember feeling frustrated disappointed really--it felt personal was really sad american was disgusted was unpatriotic was un-american were watching capitol building get defaced over lie was something was really hard moment digest knowing what had been hearing down hall conversations were happening seeing tweet come knowing what was happening hill something i--i still struggle work through emotions vice chair cheney hutchinson have also spoken multiple other white house staff about their reaction donald trump's 2:24 tweet condemning mike pence for not having courage refuse count electoral votes act would have been illegal matthew pottinger former marine intelligence officer who served white house for years including deputy national security advisor was vicinity oval office various points throughout day when saw tweet immediately decided resign his position let's watch him describe his reaction president's tweet pottinger one staff brought printout tweet president tweet said something effect mike pence vice president didn't have courage what he--``what should have been done i--i read tweet made decision moment resign that's where knew was leaving day once read tweet vice chair cheney ultimately members white house staff sarah matthews cabinet members secretary chao secretary devos resigned well here secretary devos's resignation letter can see resigning january 6th secretary devos said president there's mistaking impact your rhetoric had situation inflection point for let's also look secretary chao's resignation statement when secretary chao resigned spoke january 6th attack said sure case with many this has deeply troubled way simply cannot set aside hutchinson our prior interviews have asked about what president's advisors were urging him during attack have described roughly three different camps thoughts inside white house day can tell about those hutchinson there was group individuals were strongly urging him take immediate swift action would classify white house counsel's office herschmann ivanka trump category really working get him take action pleading with him take action there was more neutral group where advisors were trying toe line knowing trump didn't necessarily want take immediate action condemn riots but knowing something needed done then there was last group which was deflect blame let's blame antifa these aren't our people understanding meadows was deflect and-blame category but did end taking more neutral route knowing there were several advisors president's circle urging him take more action which think was reflected rhetoric released later day videos vice chair cheney told white house counsel's office was camp encouraging president tell rioters stop attack leave capitol let's listen hutchinson white house counsel's office wanted there strong statement out condemn rioters i'm confident vice chair cheney now let's look just one example what some senior advisors president were urging hutchinson could look exhibit are showing screen now have seen this note before hutchinson note wrote direction chief staff january 6th likely around o'clock vice chair cheney it's written chief staff note card but your handwriting hutchinson hutchinson handwriting vice chair cheney why did write this note hutchinson chief staff was meeting with eric herschmann potentially philbin had rushed out office fairly quickly mark had handed note card with one his pens sort-of dictating statement for president potentially put out vice chair cheney and--no sorry ahead hutchinson okay there were two phrases there one illegal one without proper authority illegal phrase was one meadows had dictated herschmann had chimed said also put without legal authority there should have been slash between two phrases was president had opted put one those statements out evidently didn't later afternoon mark came back from oval dining room put palm card desk with illegally crossed out but said didn't need take further action statement vice chair cheney your knowledge this statement was never issued hutchinson was--to knowledge was never issued vice chair cheney hutchinson did understand ivanka trump wanted her father send people home hutchinson understanding yes vice chair cheney let's play clip addressing issue hutchinson remember her saying various points know wants him--she wanted her dad send them home wanted her dad tell them home peacefully wanted include language necessarily wasn't board with time vice chair cheney will hear more about this our later hearings but have evidence many others imploring donald trump mark meadows take action here some evidence text messages sent mark meadows during attack this text message 2:32 from laura ingraham hey mark president needs tell people capitol home next message this hurting all then destroying his legacy playing into every stereotype all credibility against blm-antifa crowd things south president's son don also urgently contacted mark meadows 2:53 wrote he's got condemn this shit asap capitol police tweet not enough will see these are just two numerous examples trump supporters allies urging president tell his supporters leave capitol would not have been hard for president simply walk down briefing room few feet down hall from oval office nora o'donnell noted during interview with house republican leader kevin mccarthy where leader mccarthy said believed attack was un-american o'donnell want quickly bring kevin mccarthy house minority leader leader mccarthy condemn this violence mccarthy completely condemn violence capitol what we're currently watching unfold un-american am--i'm disappointed i'm sad this not what our country should look like this not who are this not first amendment this has stop this has stop now o'donnell leader mccarthy president united states has briefing room steps from oval office is--the cameras are hot 24/7 know why hasn't walked down said now mccarthy i--i conveyed president what think best i'm hopeful president will vice chair cheney republican house member mike gallagher also implored president call off attack gallagher president have got stop this are only person who can call this off call off election over call off this bigger than it's bigger than any member congress about united states america which more important than any politician call off it's over vice chair cheney despite fact many people close donald trump were urging him send people home did not until later much later 4:17 p.m donald trump finally told rioters home loved them here portion video president trump recorded from white house president trump have have peace home love you're very special you've seen what happens see way others are treated are bad evil know how feel but home home peace vice chair cheney but will show even greater detail future hearings donald trump was reluctant put this message out still could not bring himself condemn attack hutchinson has told too vice chair cheney one put out 4:17 hutchinson i'm sure you've discussed just elaborate hadn't already point recall him being reluctant film video 6th was not involved any logistics planning for video just remember seeing video out feeling little shocked after went out vice chair cheney evening january 6th day after president's family his senior staff others tried encourage president condemn violence commit peaceful transition power 3:31 p.m january 6th sean hannity fox news texted mark meadows hannity said can make statement saw tweet ask people leave capitol later evening hannity sent another text message mark meadows this time shared link tweet tweet reported president trump's cabinet secretaries were considering invoking 25th amendment remove president trump from office can see screen 25th amendment constitution creates process for transition power president unfit unable serve 25th amendment has never been used remove president but committee has learned after attack u.s capitol this was being discussed members president trump's cabinet way stripping full power presidency from donald trump president trump's supporters were worried addition tweet sent mark meadows after attack sean hannity apparently spoke with president trump warned him about what could happen understand this text message sean hannity sent kayleigh mcenany january 7th shows what hannity said president first more stolen election talk second impeachment 25th amendment are real many people will quit hutchinson told were hearing about discussions related 25th amendment here part what said hutchinson pompeo reached out have conversation with meadows case hadn't heard discussions amongst cabinet secretaries from what understand was more this what i'm hearing want aware but also think it's worth putting your radar because are chief staff you're technically boss all cabinet secretaries know conversations progressed should ready take action this i'm concerned for your positioning with this reach out have any questions like can helpful with all vice chair cheney inside white house president's advisors including members his family wanted him deliver speech country deputy white house counsel pat philbin prepared first draft what would president's remarks national healing delivered pre taped video january 7th when arrived white house 7th philbin believed more needed said sat down started writing shared draft with pat cipollone who also believed president needed say more cipollone agreed with content did eric herschmann who reviewed draft committee has learned president did not agree with substance drafted resisted giving speech all hutchinson recall discussions about president's speech january 7th hutchinson vice chair cheney let's listen hutchinson what told about about process crafting those remarks hutchinson learned from conversation with mark overhearing between him white house counsel eric herschmann well trump didn't necessarily think needed anything more 7th than what had already done 6th when was convinced put out video 7th he--i understand had lot opinions about what context announcement were entail had original drafts speech where know there were several lines didn't make there about prosecuting rioters calling them violent didn't want there wanted put there wanted potentially pardon them this just with increased emphasis his mindset time which was didn't think did anything wrong he--the people who did something wrong day person who did something wrong day was mike pence not standing with him vice chair cheney but president's advisors urged him give his speech george who convinced him video 7th hutchinson i'm not sure who convinced him was group people convinced him george who was group you're aware hutchinson i'm aware mark ivanka jared kushner eric herschmann pat cipollone pat philbin those are people i'm aware george know why group people thought was necessary for him release statement hutchinson believe kayleigh mcenany well from what understood time from what reports were coming there was large concern 25th amendment potentially being invoked there were concerns about what would happen senate was--if 25th was invoked primary reason had heard other than know did not enough 6th need get stronger message out there condemn this is--otherwise this will your legacy secondary reason was know think about what might happen final days your presidency don't this there's already talks about invoking 25th amendment need this cover vice chair cheney president ultimately delivered remarks unlike many his other speeches did not lib much recited them without significant alteration except one even then january 2021 day after attack u.s capitol president still could not bring himself say but this election now over one other point about speech hutchinson did hear trump one point wanted add language about pardoning those who took part january 6th riot hutchinson did hear understand meadows was encouraging language well vice chair cheney thank here what told previously about george said was instructed not include who was instructing him not include language about pardon january 7th speech hutchinson understood from white house counsel's office coming our office morning didn't think was good idea include speech george being pat cipollone hutchinson that's correct eric herschmann vice chair cheney hutchinson did rudy giuliani ever suggest was interested receiving presidential pardon related january 6th hutchinson did vice chair cheney hutchinson did white house chief staff mark meadows ever indicate was

plaintive remarks congress her country endures fifth month brutal russian siege zelenska was candid about pain suffering russia's unprovoked war aggression was causing her homeland said russia destroying our people first lady conveyed incredible determination ukrainian people echoed their simple request for tools fight their own fight--``weapons said protect one's home right wake alive home hope first lady's visit helped steel our colleagues resolve friends ukraine russia's invasion has already reminded west revisionist aggressors cannot appeased ukraine's brave resistance equipped with arsenal free world further reminder this fight intend senate should proud our work over past several months get more lethal capabilities into ukrainian hands but every step way biden administration has been bit slow green light game-changing weapons ukraine's frontline defenders actually need urged president for more than year take specific actions deter russian aggression against ukraine--actually before escalated last june urged him deliver lethal capabilities ukraine other states vladimir putin's crosshairs instead administration slow-walked security assistance for months december called for u.s military reinforcements along nato's eastern flank but president waited until february deploy forces--too late deter putin's aggression even after russia had launched its unlawful invasion president has repeatedly deterred himself from providing ukraine capabilities needs with nearly every weapons system requested ukraine cycle washington plays out like this first hesitation concern then excuses ukraine couldn't effectively use proposed weapons objections providing them would escalate conflict then then--grudging willingness transfer weapons finally with weapons ukrainian hands self-congratulations from biden administration are having positive impact battlefield exhausting watch this decision-making cycle repeat itself from kentucky must exacerbating watch from kyiv need for advanced longer-range weapons turn back russia's aggression painfully obvious air defense capabilities combat russia's continuing long-range strikes against civilian populations across ukraine anti-ship weapons combat russia black sea blockade humanitarian food crisis causing worldwide more capable longer-range artillery pound russian positions occupied ukraine from relative safety--this will help offset any numerical advantage russia has achieved pumping much more combat power into its invasion force page s3584 here putin cannot allowed believe can just wait for west become complacent would moral disservice brave ukrainians fighting every single day for their country but this not just about ukraine's security russia achieves its objective ukraine will imperil our own security waiver--if waiver--on ukraine would certainly send unmistakable signal weakness beijing which watching conflict ukraine very closely for their part are our friends allies china's backyard japan's prime minister put back may ukraine might east asia tomorrow russia's brutal war has cost people ukraine their homes their safety their lives but has also reawakened west reality long-term deterrence competition has led modern partners like sweden finland cast their lot with greatest military alliance history world has prompted current treaty allies shake off years neglect for their own defense capabilities all this will result greater burden-sharing interoperability military capability collective security for nato alliance united states cannot afford neglect this lesson ourselves leader free world target revisionist adversaries like china russia have take seriously our obligation maintain america's military superiority need act quickly pass defense authorization bill restores our readiness grows our stockpiles critical munitions reinforces our position along nato's eastern flank lays foundations for new era credible deterrence asia modernizing

classroom know what try survive mayor rotering told judiciary committee our children are expected return school about month are frightened back are frightened play outside many never want parade[s again for rest their lives will look over their shoulders ready for another active shooter thanks drills our society has normalized our classrooms continued playing outside normal back school normal fear shooter not normal but now highland park illinois many other american communities new normal can't said enough mass shootings with assault weapons are unique american phenomenon are devastating--so devastating want show another picture with aiden mccarthy this cooper roberts years old cooper his twin brother luke went parade with their mom dad page s3585 course shooting was shot taken hospital immediately has gone through least seven eight surgeries now touch for many days whether would live sadly addition damage was done his body his spinal cord was severed this same bullet

mom dad have kept posted all posted his progress but think about devastation ar-15 combat weapon assault rifle can human body imagine what did this poor little boy's body reality issue are discussing many gun manufacturers like smith wesson mossberg bushmaster daniel defense have launched campaigns marketing their assault weapons like are fashion accessories let show few them this from mossberg engineered specs freedom independence stand salute tactical rifle are america's oldest family-owned firearms manufacturer building dependable hard-working rifles shotguns since 1919 american built american strong arm yourself with mossberg type weapon shot cooper roberts killed parents aiden mccarthy how being marketed symbol independence freedom some these other ads--want proof your manhood consider your man card reissued says bushmaster with their ar-15 want make sure said hearing yesterday these weapons are properly characterized will tell how characterize them manufacturers these weapons should ashamed what happening across america suggest this typifies values this country just plain wrong offensive time for name shame these companies time hold them accountable for devastation made possible how many ar-15s are there america don't really know best estimate million--20 million want dispel common talking point hear from other side aisle heard yesterday claim our communities don't need new gun safety laws all need are good guys with guns wish were simple not one survey 433 active shooter attacks how many were stopped good guy with gun twenty-two out four hundred thirty three--about percent half those were security guards trained law enforcement who were there present scene off duty sad reality when police come scene someone holding gun don't know perpetrator danger somebody their side many instances shoot wrong person making split-second decision seeing person holding gun this notion are going come rescue one another stop mass shootings not reality five percent active shooter attacks were stopped good guy with gun--5 percent imagine buying car being told there only 5-percent chance airbag will off need crash wouldn't take car out dealership for good reason heard testimony yesterday from rand corporation firearms expert kyleanne hunter told assault weapons make mass shootings significantly more lethal evidence clear time for have national conversation about america mass shooting let say manufacturers shouldn't get off hook aren't just selling product let show one other thing particularly outrageous sadly this home state illinois jr-15 designed look like ar-15 combat weapon assault rifle lighter can carried kid here are symbols this jr-15 are skulls skulls children each one them has pacifier his mouth isn't just this poster this emblazoned gun itself this kid's assault weapon think about for second america have reached point where even thought light killing has taken place hearing yesterday showed outpouring people from highland park numbers never expected believe there were 100 people there who their own dime came out washington make sure all congress knew what happened highland park how village their lives were changed fourth july what are going about it--shrug our shoulders wait for tomorrow's mass shooting sadly can expect one come listen defenses but frankly can't understand people trying defend right own assault rifle america one senator argued well just inanimate object know don't blame object for results wonder feels same way about grenade launcher should people have right own grenade launchers hope can all agree incredible thought why doesn't this weapon fall into similar category combat army assault weapon being used individuals kill many innocent people this country--kill them concert las vegas schools connecticut schools texas fourth july parades home state last month did come together--and want salute senator murphy who floor--to pass bill was most important gun safety law considered three decades voted for didn't address this issue all except background checks for those under glad did but didn't address issue whether these guns should even america this point legal america think critical threshold issue incidentally this shooter who seemed have pretty ill-fated life from start managed buy high-capacity magazines could clip quickly rounds here rounds there fire off times why world does anyone need high-capacity clip magazine don't understand doesn't have any practical value for sport hunting need address widespread serious problem civilian access military assault weapons even for shooters young thank people from highland park for coming yesterday all brave law enforcement first responders whom saw gather evening when arrived highland park owe them lot are doing amazing job should pay tribute them what did but even being present armed could not stop this from happening were against mighty weapon--a weapon trust for military trust for police weapon which has place hands people like shooter highland park fourth july are going continue this american tradition mass shootings sadly will unless this body this senate decides worth fight worth political debate after highland park count want record saying time put end these assault rifles these weapons war which have sadly taken many innocent lives like poor aiden mccarthy's parents five others who died highland park hope for our children's sake don't run away from this problem people highland park had run away from fourth july parade now are counting stand face squarely yield floor presiding officer booker senator from tennessee biden administration mrs blackburn president america facing perfect storm inflation unsustainable energy costs supply chain chaos russia iran are circling wagons joe biden still finding new ways put american people last fact page s3586 when comes getting gas prices under control has chosen unleash china-first policy rather than unleashing power american energy have spent past months laying out great detail how joe biden democrats have damaged our credibility enriched our adversaries undermined our economic recovery abandoned border destroyed american energy independence list goes unfortunately appears everything have done makes life worse for people unfortunately emboldening axis evil--russia china iran north korea under normal circumstances vladimir putin's trip iran this week would cause for concern but with biden administration charge appears could just tip iceberg because although russia iran are competitors especially energy sector are absolutely united their hatred united states their desire undermine western interests when look united states see country whose president got head start undermining those interests day his administration better believe are ready take advantage this are ready for this week look what have done had gazprom which russian energy giant national iranian oil company come together announce billion agreement work together oil gas development pipeline construction are reading writing wall what see hesitation from u.s president move back energy independence where were day his administration are making plans how will work together dominate energy sector meanwhile joe biden has also sold about million barrels oil from our strategic petroleum reserve chinese communist party when have spoken with tennesseans about this are furious cannot understand why would make choice this left has done their best provide cover for president claiming million barrels really nothing worry about but know something worry about our spr has about 750 million barrels are drawing down about million barrels day plus president now selling our adversaries--selling did little bit research into what china can get out barrel oil here what found gives gallons gasoline 12\1/2 gallons distillate which what use for diesel fuel about 3\1/2 gallons jet fuel tennesseans this makes big difference really agree with fellow tennesseans about this when look this picture think about president's big sale hunter biden's friends beijing don't see gallon gas here there what see million full tanks gas see diesel fuel our farmers need right now with price diesel doubling have farmers tennessee who cannot get crops planted chose not plant crops because cost diesel fertilizer chemicals pesticides see sabotage their hopes their dreams their plans--their plans--for their family for their business for their farm have been out about around state talked tennesseans have message for this president this administration democratic colleagues this more than just political disagreement their minds agree this national security risk--a national security risk are making ourselves vulnerable giving any aid advantage our adversaries wrong this has got end joe biden democrats must abandon this china-first energy policy return america-first policy restart keystone pipeline approve more energy infrastructure hold more lease sales approve drilling permits are waiting for approval let's get regulators out way stall some these regulations president has put oil energy sector this year let's this let's advantage ourselves with american energy before too late yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut murphy president ask unanimous consent following senators permitted speak prior scheduled vote senator murphy for minutes senator cornyn for minutes senator coons for minutes presiding officer without objection ordered electoral reform murphy president come floor today talk about piece legislation was introduced yesterday bipartisan senators electoral count reform presidential transition improvement act proud effort between republicans democrats put aside our differences other issues able put before this body proposal will assure votes are cast all across this country for president 2024 result winner election sitting oval office come floor today underscore for colleagues why this piece legislation vitally necessary all across country are seeing epidemic candidates being nominated for governor for secretary state for congress who don't believe joe biden election instead believe these wild conspiracy theories about voting machines magically switched votes from one candidate another sharpies voted for joe biden illegally all has been debunked but conspiracy theories support for this notion donald trump actually election according rules electoral college continue spread republican nominee for governor pennsylvania who appoints state's chief election official was right here capitol yards away from this chamber january individuals were storming building trying harm took part high-level meetings after election intended overturn biden's pennsylvania perhaps mere months away from being next governor chief elections officer state across country former president trump organizing what calls america first secretary state coalition pretty unapologetic about what design install election officers all across country whose chief loyalty donald trump not vote his endorsed candidate arizona for instance called for biden's arizona thrown out for republican state legislature appoint its own electors instead nevada endorsed republican candidate for secretary state another trump loyalist says was office would not have certified joe biden's leading immediate constitutional crisis what happening all across country right now complete total rejection democracy trump supporters his endorsed candidates now aren't representative entire republican party but unfortunately are winning primaries all across country are winning elections all across country these trump loyalists are not interested winner election becoming president winner isn't donald trump effectively want donald trump installed monarch are willing just throw out democracy what necessary keep their leader power mentioned this isn't some fringe phenomenon any longer think have lot republicans senate house who see this danger coming want take steps prevent why are introducing this legislation but there are over 100 winners republican primaries for congress statewide office this year who believe--who have stated this belief publicly election was stolen donald trump should still president there just very well-developed well-organized movement where trump supporters are learning from his inability overturn election are galvanizing themselves leave nothing chance 2024 page s3587 operation install trump white house runs will more sophisticated better organized than threat 2024 will last year american democracy real know sounds like hyperbole but came really close losing our democracy president installed white house who did not actually election then don't know how claim this experiment for 250 years still ongoing need act body across aisle those who believe our loyalty country more important than our loyalty party need act make hard possible for group traitors install president loser 2024 presidential election toward end have introduced piece legislation will seek reform way which electors are sent congress way which count those electors put many barriers can these efforts install loser 2024 election president united states grateful senator collins senator manchin for leading this process grateful part along with senators portman sinema romney shaheen murkowski warner tillis capito cardin young coons sasse graham let tell just few minutes what most important elements--let just tell about some key elements electoral count reform act engages make selection counting fraudulent electors harder both addressing efforts congress overturn valid state results but also make harder for states submit congress invalid state results now january last year saw handful our colleagues attempt throw out valid elector slates from states like pennsylvania arizona luckily end those efforts only got handful votes here senate but majority republicans voted throw out those slates house representatives which just tells how mainstream these views have become two important ways make attempt congress throw out valid results from state little bit but substantially harder under our current law only takes one single senator order throw this entire senate into debate over whether not should count throw out certain electors end there were think republican senators who suggested should throw out ballots but really all was needed was what increase threshold from senator percent senators from house member percent house members begin debate ultimately still need majority house senate throw out elector slate but can't even begin debate now without having percent each body substantial important change second clarify role vice president now some would argue this isn't necessary vice president's role this process ceremonial but not what donald trump thought donald trump his cadre fringe lawyers believed reading statute particular way mike pence had ability himself refuse count certain slates electors now not how 1887 act reads but just absolutely clear our reform act clarifies law make 100 percent clear vice president's role just ceremonial then said also take steps make harder for states send fraudulent results congress because primary threat 2024 still think there are votes senate matter what elections look like 2024 for senate make sure don't throw out valid results are sent congress bigger threat one candidate wins state like arizona or--depending what happens gubernatorial election pennsylvania--pennsylvania instead state decides send electors for losing candidate congress making some vague broad claims fraud can't substantiate make exercise fraud less likely through number means first there really ambiguous provision 1887 law which president trump argued courts allowed for state legislatures appoint their own electors judged election was incomplete now what was initially intended mean was election didn't happen because natural disaster but trump's lawyers thought meant these claims fraud could satisfy incomplete criteria well removed ambiguity this underlying piece legislation longer will anybody able claim state legislatures can just step after fact appoint different electors second have clear prohibition state legislatures can't change rules how electors are chosen after election itself now state legislatures how appoint electors every state right now appoints them based upon who popular vote their state but constitution does give power state legislature does not give them power change process after voters have cast their vote make clear this piece legislation then most importantly clarify process which campaigns candidates can contest fraudulent certification fraudulent appointment electors saw 2000 election there overlapping contesting jurisdictions between states federal court system often takes very--a very long time for those processes play out unwind set this bill new expedited process review three-judge panel limit cases can brought panel campaigns themselves just make sure aren't incentivizing spurious litigation but new process allows candidates campaigns believe laws state have not been upheld allowing majority winner state dictate what electors get sent washington make claim before three-judge panel expedited fashion have case supreme court expedited manner well clarifying way which solve for these contests arise over valid slate electors invalid slate electors important reform this bill listen what have built over last 250 years united states america really miracle should never forget how much anomaly american democracy when look broad scope governments under which people have lived this idea citizens not dictators kings plutocrats get decide who leads nation--250 years later still revolutionary idea remind constituents all time democracy really unnatural right there are not lot other things are important our lives run through democratic vote our workplaces are really important places but don't run our workplace through democratic vote boss--the ceo--makes decisions there love our sports teams right follow them live die for them but decisions those teams--they are not made democratic vote there coach general manager who makes decisions love kids but don't get equal vote decisions household with wife lots things are important our lives don't run democratic vote are very comfortable fact with hierarchal systems with one person handful people making decisions for but have reserved this idea democracy for decisions are made govern our community our town our state our nation need remember over course world history almost one has lived democratic civilization why because natural for human beings want their chosen leader charge their preferred leader charge matter what everybody else community believes also natural for leaders once have tasted power want cling power refuse give matter wishes their citizenry page s3588 need constantly vigilant protect this experiment grand sweep world history what is--a revolutionary experiment need recognize moments when threats experiment are new novel more grave than normal nimble enough respond would argue this one those moments grateful group bipartisan senators who have worked hard introduce this legislation yield floor presiding officer senator from texas h.r 4346 cornyn president business before senate critical undertaking shore our vulnerability imported microcircuits otherwise known semiconductors might wonder why this important haven't been following debate over last couple years while this legislation has taken many names began chips for america act june which established new program incentivize manufacturers these tiny microcircuits known semiconductors set shop here united states have tried fund program different times through endless frontier act u.s innovation competition act sometimes called usica america competes act make america act but matter what title whatever call purpose eliminate this unacceptable risk somehow--due pandemic due military conflict due natural disaster--our access most advanced semiconductors planet would cut off with devastating consequences u.s economy our national security know some people wonder why should federal taxpayer provide financial incentives semiconductor manufacturing perfectly good question reason are competition with countries all around world are providing incentives build these necessary essential facilities their country don't participate this competition will end maintaining our dependency entirely semiconductors imported into united states saw big investments being made other countries--china germany france number different countries want this manufacturing capability their country because understand its importance their economy security now might wonder why necessary well there reason economic reason--why these semiconductor manufacturers are almost all based asia overwhelming majority are made taiwan because costs percent less build these facilities asia than does here united states but covid-19 exposed lot vulnerabilities supply chains whether ppe--personal protective equipment--or semiconductors this idea just because somebody could build something cheaper somewhere else checked all boxes does not check all boxes there are some things must have access one secure source these microcircuits run everything from your cell phone f-35 joint strike fighter know semiconductors will get more more important world competes come with smaller more powerful semiconductor chips operate everything from computers our weapons systems when pandemic hit supply chain vulnerability was demonstrated empty car lots backordered electronics higher prices contributing inflation consumers who never needed know what semiconductor was found themselves impacted this disruption state home companies across full range industries have been impacted from consumer electronics defense companies last spring executive from toyota told when first started with company could count number chips given vehicle two hands certainly not case now with almost autonomous vehicles certainly with all sensors have made driving lot safer lot more convenient added new cars think about high-tech features our cars--navigation systems bluetooth automatic braking backup cameras parking sensors top standard functions like power steering air-conditioning window wipers today some cars use many 1,000 semiconductor chips pandemic covid-19 demonstrated our vulnerability our supply chains made getting many semiconductors impossible this wasn't just problem for automakers virtually every industry was impacted many ways global chip shortage served wake call--certainly believe other members congress senate who voted consistently eliminate this vulnerability our supply chains forced recognize vulnerability supply chain then something about which are process doing bad chip-related shortages have been last years pale comparison what could coming don't act said vast majority world's chips are made asia with bulk coming from taiwan sixty-three percent advanced semiconductors world are made taiwan even more concerning percent world's most advanced semiconductors come from country percent--63 percent semiconductors come from taiwan but percent most advanced most powerful smallest semiconductors come from same place none zero zip nada are made america none taiwanese semiconductor firms make chips used our military's joint strike fighter f-35 artificial intelligence other military-grade devices now have been paying attention what president people's republic china have been saying about taiwan are saying are going unify prc with taiwan either peacefully military action again believe risk pandemic natural disaster military intervention makes this risk simply unacceptable last fall led congressional delegation visit indochina indopacom area operations learn more about threat chinese aggression when comes taiwan one leaders met with was commander indo-pacific command located hawaii who described current power dynamic rather succinctly said not question china invades taiwan but when even have rough idea when could happen president has made secret his desire unify taiwan with mainland saying wants ready 2027 just years from now but have learned from putin's invasion ukraine when one person makes decision can't depend any particular timeline because could happen blink eye tough overestimate impact this lack access these advanced semiconductors would have united states our allies sure our cars televisions refrigerators washing machines would impacted but only beginning those would mere inconveniences how would manufacture javelin missiles are used ukraine well couldn't because all run semiconductors there stinger being used effectively ukrainians after russian tanks invading ukraine joint strike fighter f-35 our most advanced fifth-generation stealth aircraft chock-full semiconductors would unavailable our access was cut off for some reason then just think about our critical infrastructure think about cell towers think about energy grid where would get chips are needed for modern farming equipment just cars have become more more automated have tractors other farming equipment what would for chips need treat water make sure clean easily available these aren't problems just for consumers major national security vulnerability back 1980 president jimmy carter gave his state union address page s3589 which spoke about instability persian gulf soviet threats movement oil through strait hormuz was back days when depended almost entirely imported oil into united states but jimmy carter said 1980 any attempt gain control strait hormuz block access essential energy source said would assault vital interests united states america would declaration war think same argument applies semiconductors today fact some people have called semiconductors new oil because essential our way life our economy our security just soviets could have blocked strait hormuz choked off global oil supply back 1980 people's republic china could seize taiwan's supply chips starve rest world will into ventilators other lifesaving medical equipment provide homes with clean drinking water these are important questions many have been asking looking try find ways mitigate not eliminate our dependency imported semiconductors funding this program this bill currently before senate will shore domestic chip manufacturing make sure meet needs our most critical industries would deliver economic benefits our communities through new investments jobs will strengthen our national security providing chips can make their way into markets around world will ensure have reliable supply chips can outinnovate outcompete any every adversary point worth stressing know are competition with people's republic china but way will beat them outcompete them only way will with access most advanced electronics including semiconductors are made anywhere planet need make them here america there can trusted supply chains readily available appreciate all our colleagues who supported this legislation for long winding journey has brought here today hope this bill will pass senate house next week finally make its

follow president trump's family members social media because know how influential are know how many americans good decent americans--admire them listen what say lately posts from trump's family members have just been one theme america should fear transgender children trump family their network supporters sycophants have decided eric verbeeck other kids like them are problem facing america today over past year this crowd has orchestrated relentless unceasing campaign marginalize demonize bully kids whose gender identity different from their biological sex this year alone republican state legislatures across country have introduced 150 bills deny rights transgender americans today alabama legislature introduced legislation fast tracked from what understand become law makes felony felony--for doctor provide healthcare transgender child texas governor directed his child welfare agency investigate parents like patricia who are simply determined support their children help them secure gender-affirming treatment need criminalizing parents transgender children just around corner some states congress trump's allies spent more time talking about transgender kids than spent talking about healthcare taxes education congresswoman marjorie taylor greene--perhaps trump's best ally house--had sign outside her office calling experience transpeople fiction just bully her hallway neighbor representative marie newman who has transgender daughter supreme court hearings here last month least one senator used their time national stage suggest entire idea being transgender leftwing hoax all across america republicans--not all republicans but trump wing republican party has declared war against transgender kids these children have noticed recent survey transgender youth showed half them--52 percent--had contemplated suicide over last year just think about for second colleagues half all kids who are transgender come conclusion some point their young lives would better off dead than live world believes are threats marginalized expunged national crisis need talk honestly candidly about what has led this moment need start acknowledging this conversation long overdue this dialogue about transgender children may feel new but transgender kids aren't transgender adults aren't only difference between today say years ago today there space for kids adults open about who truly are are all born with biological sex centuries tightly controlled constructs about what man should what man should act like what woman should what woman should act like have sorted human beings into personality professional profiles based gender but there are many us--this has been case for human history who don't associate with gender biological chance ascribed there are people who are assigned male birth who feel their bones are female what eric felt what eric knew there are people who are assigned female birth but know just know are male there nothing wrong with process figuring out which gender identify with poses threat anyone but have acknowledge how hard given those centuries gender identity stereotypes for some americans understand what kid like eric was going through for americans for instance who were born male feel like male who are surrounded family friends who associate with gender matches sex were born into whole notion boy becoming girl girl becoming boy--i get it--that can disconcerting can difficult understand but also know this discomfort will pass more americans learn what have learned transgender nonbinary children aren't any different than any other kids might not know transgender nonbinary kid but trust know what these kids are like because are different than any other children son has transgender nonbinary friends has nontransgender friends but when are all sitting around our kitchen after school there difference between them terms how act how talk what are like what like what don't like are kids are just kids here message adults with power who have decided spend their days bullying these kids stop grow are not ready accept transgender people fine hope come around someday but these kids threaten one are hurting one well there are important conversations need have about how include transgender kids fully sports could walk into room thousand people state ask how many them have had child sporting event transgender girl not single hand would raise saving girls sports not reason why donald trump marjorie taylor greene their whole political movement has made bullying transgender kids their top priority their top priority because know hate fear what some people don't understand has habit selling this country wish weren't true but has always been true there always going constituency america will listen argument for why black people mexicans muslims gay people transgender people are ruining america why should fear them not true has never been true but demagogues their movements tend not have actual ideas things are for demagogues normally just focus what hate let say again half all transgender children this country have thought themselves some point would better off dead than live world where many people fear them heartbreaking know are doing these kids being teenager today--i know have one--with social media pandemic hard enough but imagine being teenager who wakes every day knowing aren't gender were assigned biology birth imagine keeping your feelings about secret for years worried--worried--about what your parents your friends might say imagine anguish scared 12-year-old 14-year-old sitting bed page s2078 awake for hours each night trying process all alone with help imagine courage then takes for kid have first conversation with parent friend then layer top some most powerful people world deciding use their power not cure disease end poverty hunger but instead use their power target those very scared desperate kids use their powers harass bully shame them imagine how small how insecure how weak person must have all power use bully children seth walsh was gay not transgender but his experience was not much different than eric's students his school were systematic their targeting him because his sexual orientation pushed him down stairs kicked him until was badly bruised screamed him called him names doubt these bullies took direction inspiration from adults who paved way who

necessary address this chamber's rules order accomplish goal senate going act soon tomorrow intention once again bring legislation floor fight back against threats democracy protect people's access ballot once again urge republican colleagues take flag traditional republican party not only lincoln but reagan bush bush vote yes move forward can have debate like debate just had discussion just had but republicans continue hijack rules senate prevent voting rights from happening continue paralyzing this chamber point where are helpless fight back against big lie must consider necessary steps can take senate can adapt act for past few months senate democrats have been holding talks within our caucus discern how can best move forward restore function senate more importantly pass legislation defend democracy protect voting rights last night held another round talks with number colleagues about path forward did again this morning over past few days our republican colleagues have escalated their attacks against our efforts pass voting rights legislation listen this one last night republican leader worked place number gotcha bills onto legislative calendar some sort payback for pursuing legislation protect sacred right vote was basically saying here are bills democrats don't like let's for votes those well proposed republican leader unanimous consent request would perfectly fine with taking votes his bills simple majority threshold exchange agreed same for freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act course republican leader immediately objected--immediately objected--to having all them done with votes bills proposed our voting rights bills republican leader made clear last night true worry other side isn't about rules senate--rules were perfectly happy change pursue their own objectives when were majority republicans truth are afraid possibility legislation defend democracy fight power dark money protect voting rights could move forward this chamber mentioned colleague from texas not all republicans not republicans out country--a lot them want protect voting rights--but republican party now run fair say run donald trump who has propagated big lie election was stolen really even though million votes even though has evidence nor have commentators effect now have least republicans senate house lots state legislatures completely going along with this big lie danger there jaundices our democracy people color young people older people people urban areas feel their right vote being diminished compared other people's--because are not aiming this everybody--democracy begins wither have not seen assault voting rights since days old south since forties fifties sixties seventies why would want regress why would want regress must fight back now understand our republicans are going continue their opposition through flurry speeches decrying any effort democrats undo these voter suppression laws make easier for americans vote way would remind colleagues this has been grand tradition america when constitution was written most states had white male protestant property owner vote one says let's back those days general america with our march freedom our march equality embodied our constitution great minds founding fathers--the greatest group geniuses ever assembled--has marched forward there have been regressions but have marched forward democrats want continue march want stop these types laws republican leader doesn't have much say has latched onto talking point said big lie actually warnings voter suppression come from democrats even though there are many laws are obviously done suppress votes lot these republican legislators say openly would say republican leader his attempts misdirect from danger donald trump's big lie try say democrats who are doing gaslighting pure simple there evidence--no evidence leader did again yesterday today floor implying one more time because election was indeed successful somehow voter suppression doesn't exist now answered friend from texas when held chart republican leader cherry-picked examples distract from real unmistakable changes are taking place states would ask republican leader republican senator from texas every other republican election were successful secure safe says was then why have republican state legislators rushed make harder for people vote aftermath election why can any republican cling view election was stolen--donald trump's big lie--when john cornyn friend from texas there with chart saying election was successful republican leader said same thing doesn't rebut donald trump doesn't rebut those who came capitol motivated donald trump's propagation big lie doesn't rebut all state legislators who want make harder vote election were successful despite republican leader's best efforts have yet hear from republican colleagues why for states like georgia make crime give food water people who are waiting line polls when hear minority areas urban areas lines are much longer than rural areas have yet hear from republicans why states like texas arizona have made felony--a felony--for nonpartisan election workers send page s130 unsolicited mail ballot applications voters what wrong with sending what wrong with encouraging people vote participation elections much higher many western countries than ours again texas didn't just prohibit nonpartisan election workers from sending mail ballots out voters made felony--a felony these states have effectively made crime--a crime--for election workers proactively help people vote where justification where evidence this massive fraud donald trump talks about one gives any yet predicate their policy moves here senate date have heard explanation from other side why states like texas iowa montana have reduced polling locations hours iowa early voting any kind has been cut days how does make election more secure why grand tradition making easier for americans vote georgia according atlanta journal-constitution leading newspaper atlanta number absentee drop boxes four large counties atlanta atlanta area will drop from 111 23--111 one justifications these boxes are longer helpful but this ignores fact over 300,000 voters used them last election--the last successful election according friend from texas republicans know most people who used those drop boxes course were democrats tend use them more why are cutting them off examples unfortunately this not just one-off one state another this massive campaign which nothing will continue get worse states like texas florida kansas iowa new hampshire montana have passed laws making harder--harder--to register vote states like alabama iowa texas have passed laws increase potential for people with disabilities again georgia one rural county lincoln county trying limit their polling places just one whole county--just one place vote for entire county--causing people potentially drive many miles cast ballot this wouldn't make voting easier turns into burden truth our republicans can't defend these laws are not going mention them here today let's hear some republicans defend these laws point evidence massive fraud say motivates them bunk--bunk policies have put forward have one purpose--one purpose only making harder for younger poorer non-white typically democratic voters access ballot give republicans partisan advantage polls making harder for democratic-leaning voters vote again democracy when election figure out why try over voters don't stop voters from voting what happens autocracies places like hungary where donald trump just endorsed orban who whittling away democracy hungary cynical--cynical--for our republican colleagues argue just because these voter suppression laws don't spell their intentions out open there nothing sinister play but these laws have real impact potentially divisive arizona president your state secretary state has concluded new laws could purge many 200,000 voters from their early voting list know better than arizona has long tradition early mail-in voting think was set republicans not wrong georgia over 1.3 million voters used absentee ballots last election which could now affected restriction senate democrats iowa argue today's voter suppression laws had been effect over 6,500 absentee ballots would not have been counted last election this isn't all difficult comprehend when pass laws raise barriers voting fewer people end voting fact president will say later are approaching decisive moment for country voting rights defending democracy have long been bipartisan issues this chamber voting rights act 1964 one crowning achievements not only civil rights era but history this chamber way power grab say senate will pass laws make easier simpler safer for american citizens exercise their most fundamental right has been part grand tradition this country--usually mentioned several times before bipartisan will add proceed cannot hang our hats false hopes inadequate sometimes chimerical solutions substituting electoral count act for much needed reforms have freedom vote john lewis voting rights act insufficient unacceptable obviously doesn't affect house senate obviously not immediately urgent because affects 2024 but most importantly scorekeeping matters little game rigged game danger being rigged state republicans empower themselves arbitrate results future elections instead being arbitrated what traditionally has happened america nonpartisan election workers need work this chamber pass real solutions heart problem need proceed with john lewis voting rights act need proceed with freedom vote act all this chamber must make choice about how will our part preserve our democratic republic can't satisfied thinking democracy will out end are not willing put work defend need pass these bills our democracy can long endure after this present danger continue blocking these efforts offer implicit endorsement donald

proceeded call roll mcconnell madam president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded acting president pro tempore without objection ordered recognition minority leader republican leader recognized inflation mcconnell madam president for past year half washington democrats have continually found new ways wrong about u.s economy last springtime democrats insisted their plan dump 1.9 trillion onto economy would not cause inflation here was democratic leader march 2021 not think dangers inflation least near term are very real here was president biden biggest risk not going too big it's too small well obviously were entirely wrong their reckless spending fueled worst inflation years alvarado teacher mother three explained reporter--here what said when say cannot buy anything this week else we'll into overdraft husband says what are talking about we're both working shouldn't happen well shouldn't have happened but exactly what democrats policies have inflicted working families this country every time fill our van i'm flabbergasted alvarado explains i'm always worrying can postpone mortgage two weeks but then becomes two more weeks then all sudden they're calling after democrats policies did cause inflation moved their next wrong prediction president biden admitted inflation did fact exist but said was expected temporary one didn't work out either was over year ago then months ago early december president biden promised inflation had peaked--wrong again didn't peak december just kept getting worse inflation set fresh new 40-year high just last month these same folks are preparing for yet another battle against reality advance gdp numbers coming out later this week biden administration has begun their latest project frantic effort redefine word recession white house published whole explanation insisting even new data suggested our country recession actually won't almost beyond satire white house isn't focusing their energies page s3621 correcting their mistakes making economy better for working families who are hurting instead their priority telling everybody things aren't bad look feel want working americans like alvarado believe democrats spin instead their own lying eyes guess whopping percent americans who say are struggling stay where are financially are supposed read white house press release cheer same people who said inflation wouldn't happen then said would transitory then said had peaked last year are now insisting aren't heading into recession well draw your own conclusions prescription drug costs madam president another matter staring down barrel economic disaster have created washington democrats still don't appear pumping brakes their reckless agenda for example same democrats who spent our country into inflation are now angling regulate our medical cures industry into fewer new cures fewer lifesaving treatments american researchers manufacturers are driving force behind cutting-edge treatments entire world relies american innovators are leading races cure terminal illnesses like parkinson's alzheimer's entire world benefits from our genius but particular american people get first fastest access latest new treatments cures medical marvels but democrats pursuit prescription drug socialism could put all this risk arbitrary top-down government price controls would dry out wells american innovation tune hundreds billions dollars research development american patients would feel pain cost breakthrough cures measured dollars but cost neglecting them would measured years american life one academic analysis pegged true cost cumulative 331.5 million years let say again one expert says negative effects democrats proposal medical research would cost collective total 331.5 million cumulative years life other words their proposal would eventually destroy many years americans lives there are americans live them just years ago democrats were lining with republicans rest country cheer american researchers innovators who were driving race for covid-19 vaccine--a race finished record time american people know what looks like when lifesaving advances happen right here home unfortunately may about find what happens when don't burma madam president now one final matter over weekend burma's long difficult struggle toward democracy freedom took another dark step backward brutal military junta controlling burma executed--executed--four political prisoners including well-known activist jimmy phyo zeya thaw former elected official protest musician--yet more innocent bloodshed for crime dissenting against junta's illegitimate rule this yet another atrocity long list horrors committed junta with legitimacy regard for sanctity human life respect for its fellow citizens provides even further evidence junta does not fear any consequences for its actions--not from internal chaos not from civil war not from its neighbors not from so-called international community united states has led efforts support burma's people impose costs consequences junta clearly time for burma's neighbors shoulder larger burden well time for asean states step individually collectively junta plunges burma deeper into chaos civil war turmoil will affect entire region burma's neighbors who have most economic influence over junta burma's neighbors who have most stake want failed state wracked civil war like syria their borders want russian chinese-backed client state their midst will not step impose meaningful costs junta biden administration should use authorities already given congress sanction burma's energy sector including myanmar oil gas enterprise notwithstanding concerns those neighbors people burma are risking their lives some cases losing their lives defend their freedom biden administration claims prioritize democracy human rights its foreign policy here opportunity demonstrate means what says sum time for burma's neighbors act not biden

have criminal liability for professional medical care something this nation should never see but face now show leadership come together hope bring back constitutional protections have been case for years this country yield floor presiding officer duckworth senator from texas chips act 2022 cornyn madam president was preparing come floor was going say are going have vote tonight proceed fill major gap our national security although looks like mother nature weather may prevent vote tonight may tomorrow but still expect next couple days for address major gap our national security more than year half after original chips act became law are finally approaching finish line race fund may recall was june senator warner senior senator democrat from virginia introduced chips for america act address frightening supply chain vulnerability when comes most advanced semiconductors world percent which come from asia percent come from taiwan defense secretary lloyd austin recently wrote letter congressional leaders saying funding chips act critical our national defense last week former secretary state cia director mike pompeo also urged congress pass this funding saying cost compromise this bill pales comparison costs will suffer allow chinese communist party one day own control access our most critical technologies agree with both these statements one democrat appointee another republican appointee chips underpin virtually all technology use keeps safe home protects our troops around world for those not conversant with role semiconductors play these microprocessors underpin literally everything has off-and-on switch obviously our dependency kind technology will nothing but increase days months years ahead from our major military assets like f-35 joint strike fighter everyday technologies keep our troops safe like advanced body armor semiconductors are key keeping ready dependable supply chain these defense assets requires lot semiconductors right now are mainly looking other countries manufacture them matter fact united states america makes zero percent most advanced semiconductors world depend outsourcing virtually all manufacturing other countries produce none them here roughly percent semiconductor manufacturing globally concentrated china east asia 100 percent world's most advanced chipmaking capacity located only two places--taiwan south korea said taiwan commands percent world's advanced chipmaking united states makes zero might wonder how did find ourselves this situation well think was probably supply chain vulnerabilities saw from covid-19 called into question this assumption just because something could made cheaper somewhere else world necessarily checked all boxes well does all are depending china make toys for our children other nonessential items but when are talking about very brains behind technology need ranging from our cell phone said our most sophisticated military weapons does not check all boxes say will just import those from abroad where can made cheaper because vulnerable supply chain disrupted could cause not only severe economic depression america but also threaten our national security directly access those chips were cut off restricted would creek without paddle couldn't produce stockpile javelin missiles supply ukraine produce radios communications devices keep our troops our allies connected why shoring this domestic supply this manufacturing capacity key national security priority this best way protect one our most critical supply chains ensure our military readiness will not compromised people's republic china chinese communist party which has threatened way invade taiwan where vast majority these advanced semiconductors are made but wouldn't necessarily require military intervention could another pandemic could natural disaster--anything might block our access these advanced semiconductors while closing national security gap top priority here can't ignore major economic consequences this legislation will deliver well when introduced this legislation with senator warner from virginia who chairman senate intelligence committee which also serve our focus was national security obviously many our states will winners when comes economic consequences this legislation well texas has been for example longstanding leader semiconductor industry home more than 200 chip manufacturing facilities employ 29,000 texans for years our state has reaped benefits semiconductor manufacturing most these are what are called legacy chips are older chips where are not concerned about miniaturization compactness power--things for example run our refrigerators sets other consumer electronics maybe even our cars are already seeing types investments this chips bill will finally bring earlier this summer texas instruments metroplex dallas-fort worth broke ground first four new fabs sherman about hour north dallas this part billion investment expected create some 3,000 more jobs mayor sherman where this located northeast texas described watershed day noting it's hard have frame reference for billion investment town 50,000 people sherman isn't only town texas preparing for major chips boom last fall joined leaders from samsung--a south korean company with large facility already austin tx--when announced billion additional investment new chip fab taylor just outside austin facility expected directly create more than 2,000 high-tech jobs well thousands other related jobs once operational because these fabs manufacturing facilities are not stand-alone are part what ultimately will become ecosystem suppliers other affiliated industries will built around them creating thousands more jobs but also learned from samsung are not likely stop there pass this chips for america funding this week samsung currently considering whether expand its investment include new chipmaking facilities central texas moves forward with this plan which again depends our passage this legislation this week could lead nearly 200 billion additional investments create 10,000 jobs know tough comprehend--the economic growth sweeping benefits would come with 200 billion investment 10,000 new jobs but exciting these potential investments are there something even better this just beginning companies around world are eyeing texas united states for new investments chipmaking applied materials nxp semiconductors page s3625 infineon globalwafers globitech number other companies are looking building expanding their facilities texas other parts country globalfoundries for example investing billion boost production new york intel plans build 20-billion facility two fabs ohio taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company--tsmc called--is building 12-billion plant arizona have already broken ground plant but made clear their willingness make investment complete fab will depend our passage chips for america act once this legislation passes expect more good news follow this not just good news for our individual states but also for our national economy our global competitiveness are not used providing these kinds financial incentives businesses but when costs percent less build these manufacturing facilities across seas asia our access supply chain potentially jeopardized very real threats necessary investment for make are seeing other places around world providing similar incentives for example european union but doesn't necessarily solve our supply chain problem need jobs investment here america for truly safe secure reap economic benefits this investment economic front this funding has support many groups outside including bipartisan support mentioned earlier state texas association business u.s chamber commerce for example have heard from national governors association which bipartisan organization u.s governors well u.s conference mayors which represent state local leaders across country governor governor abbott called this bill opportunity lock even greater economic potential proud support this legislation after all this time will especially glad when finish line sight cross successfully later this week yield floor presiding officer senator from vermont sanders madam president like senator from texas wish speak about so-called chips bill but perspective say least little bit different mind what chips bill represents question whether not will have priorities this country represent needs working families middle class whether this institution entire congress totally beholden wealthy powerful corporate interests not argue with anyone who makes point there global shortage microchips semiconductors which making harder for manufacturers produce cars cell phones household appliances electronic equipment need this shortage fact costing american workers good-paying jobs raising prices for families why personally strongly support need expand u.s microchip production but question should asking this should american taxpayers provide microchip industry with blank check--blank check--of over billion same exact time when semiconductor companies are making tens billions dollars profits paying their ceos exorbitant compensation packages really one questions should asking think answer resounding this enormously profitable industry according associated press article read today senator romney reflecting views think many--i think senator cornyn made same point--but senator romney was quoted saying when other countries subsidize manufacturing high technology chips united states must join club--must join club don't play like play then are not going manufacturing high technology chips are essential for our national defense well our economy senator romney said now find position senator romney others really quite interesting because personally have been this floor many many times urging senate look other countries around world learn from those countries what have said bit absurd here united states are only major country earth not guarantee healthcare all their people senator romney says join club agree let's join club not spend twice much per capita healthcare canadians british french let's join club guarantee healthcare all people rather than making insurance companies billions profits every single year senator romney says join club agree should join club terms higher education germany today other countries around world make sure their young people can their colleges universities tuition-free don't have leave school 100,000 debt let's join club let's what germany other countries are doing which makes eminent sense every sense word let's guarantee right all our kids regardless their income get higher education let's join club there another club think might want join among many others are only major country--virtually only country earth--that does not guarantee paid family medical leave there are women today united states america having baby will back work week because need income--no guaranteed paid family medical leave there are people getting fired today because their kids are sick have make choice whether hang their jobs take care their sick kids let's join club let's what not only every major country earth does terms guaranteed paid family medical but what virtually all countries including some poorest world but gather problem join those clubs terms universal healthcare terms paid family medical leave terms free tuition public colleges universities are going have take powerful special interests make campaign contributions not what senate does when comes joining club with other countries giving blank checks large corporations club unfortunately many colleagues here feel comfortable joining apparently when corporate america needs blank check billion what other countries are doing there lot talk about microchip crisis facing this country but amazingly enough very little discussion about how got where are today one might ask there crisis how did happen well let's review some recent history this really quite amazing over last years microchip industry has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants other establishments united states eliminated 150,000 american jobs while moving most its production overseas way did after received federal grant loans much smaller than what are talking about today here absurd situation are crisis caused industry shutting down america moving abroad today what are doing saying are going give blank check undo damage did let just give few examples don't have whole lot information this between 2010 2014 intel laid off approximately 1,400 workers from rio rancho chip facility offshored 1,000 jobs israel according oregon bureau labor industry intel laid off more than 1,000 workers oregon between 2015 2016 texas instruments outsourced 400 jobs from their houston manufacturing facility philippines 2013 micron technology has repeatedly cut jobs boise including 1,100 2003 another 1,100 page s3626 2007 1,500 2008 2009 company stopped manufacturing some types chips entirely laid off 2,000 workers other words order make more profits these companies took government money used ship good-paying jobs abroad now their reward for causing crisis are these same companies are line receive massive taxpayer handout undo damage did wow heck policy bribe companies undo damage caused estimated total five major semiconductor companies will receive lion's share this taxpayer handout intel texas instruments micron technology global boundaries samsung these five companies alone made billion profits know find interesting have heard senators here floor talk about entitlements when help working people when help poor people there are all kinds requirements--work requirements reporting requirements drug testing requirements name requirements when federal government helps working people low-income people well what are requirements attached this handout for large profitable corporations answer zero company will likely benefit most from this taxpayer assistance intel 2021 last year intel made nearly billion profits know just does astound have heard people come floor say can't help working parents with their kids don't believe those entitlement programs can't guarantee healthcare all people are not entitlement society but company last year made billion profits are entitled what estimate will between billion federal funding during pandemic during last several years intel had enough money spend 16.6 billion not research development not building new plants america but buying back its own stock reward its executives wealthy shareholders here absurd moment are mentioned moment ago estimated intel will receive between billion federal funding yet within last several years same company spent over billion stock buybacks there guarantee this bill other companies receive these grants will not continue stock buybacks this way corrupt political system works hope everybody understands over past years intel has spent over 100 million lobbying campaign contributions lot money 100 million but this what corrupt political system about for 100 million lobbying campaign contributions are going get least billion corporate welfare would argue pretty good investment what goes here not only with microchip industry but with pharmaceutical industry fossil fuel industry insurance industry--huge amounts money lobbying campaign contributions pharmaceutical industry has 1,500 paid lobbyists right now right here washington which why pay highest prices world for prescription drugs find this extraordinary maybe only person here who does but rather amazing little over week ago ceo intel gentleman named pat gelsinger who earns something like 179 million year compensation--not bad salary--did interview cnbc's squawk box program think listen interview tells everything need know about oligarchy arrogance state american politics this what gelsinger said love this message gelsinger's message congressional leaders hey i'm not done with job don't get home neither should not home for august recess until have passed chips act because now listen this others industry will make investment decisions want those investments u.s are simply not competitive enough them here industry need europe asia for those get job done not home for august recess without getting these bills passed other words what telling point blank who puppet who puppeteer don't home this august until give billion because don't are going asia are going europe state american politics--and not only american politics would say equally true other countries are also held hostage large multinational corporations let clear ceo intel saying don't give his industry billion blank check his particular company billion despite doubt their profound love for america--i sure have got big american flags all over place their patriotism their concern for needs military healthcare industry which fact need these sophisticated chips not give them this bribe despite their love america their concern about our national defense--you heard senator cornyn talking about national defense right this national defense issue despite all all their love for america are willing asia europe order make even more money said last week thankfully not lawyer but sure sounds like extortion gelsinger's words sure sound like extortion what saying don't give his industry billion are out are not going build united states are going abroad have few questions for gelsinger other microchip ceos intel others receive corporate welfare check from taxpayers america are willing commit today will not outsource american jobs overseas yes this legislation passes will intel others commit today will not spend another penny stock buybacks enrich wealthy shareholders but will instead spend money create jobs united states this legislation goes into effect will intel others commit today will stay neutral any union organizing campaign like one being waged intel's microchip plant hillsboro this legislation goes into effect will intel others commit today are prepared issue warrants for federal government taxpayers america get reasonable return their investments these grants are going provide whole lot profit for these companies seems taxpayers should benefit well intel others were prepared say yes any these questions don't think would lobbying against amendment impose these very same conditions this legislation let simply conclude saying this worry not only about this bill worry about precedent states allows what precedent any company prepared abroad has ignored needs american people will then say congress hey want stay here had better give handout manufacture virtually all our laptop computers china manufacture virtually all our cell phones china pass this legislation expect all these guys others will back here saying want for our industry what did for microchip industry bottom line here yes need rebuild microchip industry united states but not handout let sit down work intelligent industrial policy let work series agreements protect american taxpayer american workers not just wealthy

for rule law encourage people home read what judge carter wrote consider his words very carefully his warnings about ongoing threat american democracy should alarm every person this country want read short excerpt from judge carter's ruling eastman president trump launched campaign overturn democratic election action unprecedented american history their campaign was not confined ivory tower was coup search legal theory plan spurred violent attacks seat our nation's government led death several law enforcement officers deepened public distrust our political process more than year after attack our capitol public still searching for accountability proud say this committee helping lead search for accountability why are here tonight let's turn scavino navarro these aren't household names colleagues will share some details about who are why are important our investigation short these two men played key role ex-president's efforts overturn results election select committee subpoenaed them for records testimony learn more about their roles what knew scavino's case strung along for months before making clear believes above law navarro despite sharing relevant details podcasts his own book also stonewalled contempt report published last night gets into weeds this but broadly scavino navarro are making similar excuses are claiming information want from them shielded executive privilege remind everyone executive privilege power president make sure official sensitive information conversations stay private privilege used protect presidency our national security usually involves president president's closest advisors cabinet secretaries top aides lead-up january 6th scavino navarro were both government employees worked white house drew salaries paid taxpayers had conversations with ex-president now are saying won't answer any our questions because executive privilege there are couple big problems with their argument first generally speaking executive privilege doesn't belong just any white house official belongs president here president biden has been clear executive privilege does not prevent cooperation with select committee either scavino navarro while ex-president reportedly has raised privilege concerns when comes scavino navarro's case nobody has even tried invoke privilege except navarro himself just not way works peter navarro isn't president important note even president has formally invoked executive privilege regarding testimony witness which not case here witness has obligation sit down under oath assert privilege question question but these witnesses didn't even bother show second ex-president had legitimate claim executive privilege this privilege applies things happen official capacity scavino navarro are claiming all information have protected executive privilege are basically saying everything did did their official roles paid taxpayers said before want talk scavino navarro about their roles attempt overturn american election american people didn't pay their salaries now there are lot laws set out what government officials aren't allowed when are clock using government resources important taxpayer dollars don't support political activity there are few bright lines about every specific situation can't sit office capitol hill make fundraising calls every staff member has take ethics training every year remind them what out bounds don't mean make light but just for record for those watching home trying overturn election out bounds--way out bounds yet scavino navarro say won't talk about causes january 6th because were white house officials time engaged official business executive privilege stands way potentially played part attack american democracy but can ignore our investigation because worked for government time their argument are not fooling anybody are obligated comply with our investigation have refused crime our investigation aims give american people lot answers about great many matters but think will also leave with some unanswered questions consider for yourselves questions about sort people who deserve power responsibility positions public trust for great many means something profound when raise our hands swear oath haven't finished work our investigation but can say confidently many involved run-up january 6th oath statement fidelity our democracy was nothing more them than meaningless words fear what happens those people are again given reins power these men scavino navarro are contempt congress encourage colleagues support adoption this report confident house will

false were unsupported evidence yet despite all these specific warnings president trump his team moved willfully through multiple means attempt halt peaceful transfer power halt our constitutional process for counting votes shatter constitutional bedrock our great nation federal judge concluded today illegality president trump's plan for january 6th was obvious today chairman noted address two specific witnesses who have refused appear for testimony scavino worked directly with president trump spread president trump's false message election was stolen recruit americans come washington with false promise january 6th would opportunity take back their country this effort deceive was widely effective widely destructive committee has many questions for scavino about his political social media work for president trump including his interactions with online forum called thedonald with qanon bizarre dangerous cult president trump working with scavino successfully spread distrust for our courts which had repeatedly found basis overturn election trump's stolen election campaign succeeded provoking violence january 6th this point there doubt committee has videos interviews sworn

effort hide certain white house records behind shield executive privilege court said case under any tests advocated former president trump profound interests disclosure advanced president biden

about attempts overturn election vice chair noted because navarro held title director white house national trade council but devoted much his time white house political efforts outside scope his official duties fact american people are likely know navarro solely his political capacity was active reelection campaign united states special counsel ruled navarro repeatedly violated hatch act

chairman yield back chairman thompson gentleman yields back chair now recognizes gentlewoman from florida mrs murphy mrs murphy thank chairman will just pick where colleague aguilar left off over month half ago navarro was subpoenaed this committee sought documents testimony regarding his efforts discredit election prevent results from being certified this information central our committee's inquiry navarro refused comply making cursory claim executive privilege there are many reasons why this blanket assertion executive privilege lacks merit matter law matter common sense most fundamentally neither incumbent nor former president has asserted privilege regarding navarro's testimony document production committee navarro has unilateral authority assert privilege himself beyond foundational flaw navarro's privilege claim since election has spoken written widely about precise subjects are focus our subpoena clearly navarro eager tell his story sees long can his own terms for example 2021 navarro published three-part report his website called navarro report makes allegations about election fraud have been debunked furthermore november 2021 navarro published book called trump time describes detail actions took change outcome election for instance navarro claims credit for working with steve bannon concoct scheme called green bay sweep core this plan was encourage vice president pence delay certification electoral college votes january 6th send election back state legislators his book navarro also writes called attorney general william barr asking department justice support president trump's legal efforts challenge election results which barr declined notably navarro acknowledges kept journal detailing this episode other post-election actions took finally earlier this year same time was refusing comply with our subpoena navarro made multiple media appearances during which discussed his various roles events culminated january 6th attack would like play video media clip right now can please cue clip navarro it's funny about this interview which kind-of interesting it's like have much knowledge share with about what was involved what know melber given have told have plan pushed delay deal with certification navarro yes melber continuing told 100 members back have said public trump was board say all those things out here why risk legal battle going jail refuse discuss them with committee under oath navarro because have loyalty constitution loyalty president president has invoked executive privilege this matter it's not authority revoke privilege melber say it's not your privilege waive navarro that's law it's law melber continuing but let's look how often have waived let's look some news have made these topics take look begin video clip reid former trump advisor peter navarro spilling beans navarro had over 100 congressmen senators capitol hill ready implement sweep bannon peter navarro navarro right boss tells pence take friggin call voice peter navarro tells rolling stone navarro was about sending votes back navarro most all those states would decertify election end video clip melber how expect people take seriously your claim this secret privileged when have been out there talking about when bannon said committee's dog wouldn't bark were afraid report--it seems now peter like dog has barked mrs murphy thank has much knowledge share with journalists but refuses share knowledge response lawful subpoena evidently navarro only concerned with executive privilege with keeping certain matters confidential when convenient for him unfortunately for him fortunately for american public not how law works president incumbent former has claimed privilege regarding navarro's testimony documents any event his claim executive privilege severely undermined not foreclosed altogether his extensive public disclosures same issues committee seeks question him about under oath result his actions navarro clearly contempt congress should referred department justice for criminal prosecution yield back chairman thompson gentlewoman yields back chair recognizes gentleman from maryland raskin raskin thank chairman know hero tom paine said cause america cause mankind today democracy under siege all over world just are working defend fortify democracy abroad ukraine other places are working defend fortify democracy here home assault american democracy exploded january 6th chairman had two coordinated elements have been able see one was violent insurrection from outside infused propaganda disinformation led domestic violent extremist groups like oath keepers proud boys three percenters qanon networks militia groups but other component was secret campaign inside replace our constitutional process governing presidential elections with tissue lies counterfeit processes make mockery american democracy this what political scientists call self-coup not coup against president like most coups but coup organized president against constitutional framework itself two contempt citations vote tonight will persons who have critical information about both components this assault america coordination between them peter navarro worked overthrow election nullifying electoral college votes cast tens millions americans who live arizona georgia pennsylvania michigan new mexico wisconsin had his so-called green bay sweep which way insult green bay packers all over country but had his so-called green bay sweep not been blocked bravery our police officers 150 whom were injured wounded hospitalized insurrectionary violence vice president pence's refusal abandon his constitutional duties this attempted coup would have permanently ended peaceful transition power america threatening survival democracy constitution united states district judge david carter put powerfully his remarkable decision today rejecting claims navarro's comrade these efforts john eastman subpoenaed navarro produce documents february 23rd 2022 appear for deposition march 2nd has produced documents failed appear for his scheduled deposition peter navarro must held criminal contempt congress american people because acting with criminal contempt for congress american people american people want know what sets him above law supreme court said 1950 u.s bryant subpoena creates public duty which every person within jurisdiction government bound perform when properly summoned supreme court emphasized duty all citizens cooperate with subpoena but navarro invokes words executive privilege repeats phrase over over again not privilege waive thinks has found magic wand nullify powers u.s congress just like thinks has found magic wand nullify powers states cast their own electoral college votes now navarro's statement executive privilege not his waive fact accurate but executive privilege not navarro's waive then neither for exact same reason definition his assert first place supreme court has been clear executive privilege belongs president united states february 28th 2022 white house counsel notified navarro president biden determined assertion executive privilege not justified with respect navarro's effort cover evidence his participation this assault america's constitutional democracy navarro then appears fall back vague assertion executive privilege here belongs former president trump which not only dubious but entirely irrelevant because our committee has not been given any attempted invocation executive privilege donald trump either formally informally indirectly peter navarro directly donald trump nothing there plainly assertion executive privilege here either actual president any former president even there were even president biden tried assert executive privilege for peter navarro would fail immediately because privilege does not apply private political business much less criminal activity like conducting coups insurrections against government privilege applies only professional speech government policy advisors rendering confidential advice matters within their domain professional responsibility now peter navarro was white house trade advisor was not within his job description overthrow presidential elections coerce vice presidents into abandoning their constitutional responsibilities impose counterfeit regimes place u.s constitution when navarro was plotting overthrow election canceling out electoral college votes million americans six states seize presidency for his chosen candidate for years was not rendering advice trade policy are not seeking documents testimony from navarro related his official duties trade advisor indeed press call announce release his outlandish cartoonish three-part report outright fraud election his personal website navarro acknowledged publicly was writing private citizen not federal government official please spare nonsense talk about executive privilege rejected now every court has looked this america there executive privilege here for presidents much less trade advisors plot coups organize insurrections against people's government people's constitution then cover evidence their crimes courts aren't buying neither are navarro insists only adding insult his contempt more than year after biden beat trump more than million votes navarro continues spread big lie trump says beyond any shadow doubt this election was stolen brags about his work with steve bannon apply pressure vice president pence wrong thing tells complete story his book trump time his three-part report which was made titles like immaculate deception art steal how tried get pence abandon his constitutional duties force contest into contingent presidential election under 12th

new trade agreements with mexico canada repeated efforts help people save has been honor serve with now will excuse intend peel bark off this bill front right now madam speaker this bill charade flimsy excuse for years has been used justify political targeting former president trump this week democrats congress finally accomplished their goal for first time history making public full actual tax returns private citizen this unprecedented action jeopardizes right every american protected from political targeting congress are told president trump's returns must released order for irs conduct its presidential audits absurd like going doctor being told your private medical records must released order examined one has nothing with other then would quickly realize someone just wants release your medical records any excuse will let clear republicans concerns are not whether president should have made his tax returns public has been tradition nor about accuracy his tax returns for irs taxpayer determine our concern this politically motivated action sets terrible precedent unleashes dangerous new page h9993 political weapon reaching far beyond any president overturns decades privacy protections for average americans have existed since watergate reforms our current law was put place specifically prevent presidents members congress from targeting political enemies through their tax returns unfortunately supreme court chose not intervene stop flimsy admittedly partisan democrat efforts target former president now result thanks this week's actions longstanding privacy protections for all taxpayers have been gutted going forward majority chairman house ways means committee senate financial committee will have nearly unlimited power target make public tax returns private citizens political enemies business labor leaders even supreme court justices themselves party congress should hold power individual should hold power embarrass harass destroy private citizen through disclosure their private tax returns after nearly half century political enemies list back washington d.c will unleash cycle political retribution congress many congress believed current law was strong enough protect private citizens against this political targeting but longer frightening republicans will continue fight protect american taxpayers from this abuse power will surely have severe consequences for taxpayers democracy for years come have urged our democrat friends turn back because making private tax information public will regrettable stain both our committee congress will make american politics even more ugly divisive long run believe every member congress will come regret this madam speaker strongly oppose this bill today not because portions doesn't have merit some but has serious flaws course because didn't exist hours ago had been brought forward years ago years ago years ago honest attempt improve presidential audits convinced could have found common ground with need expose private tax returns anyone but not now not this bill not this way republicans will not support any measure whose only purpose provide cover for political targeting private citizen madam speaker reserve balance time neal madam speaker still intend say kind things about ranking member despite peeling bark off legislation madam speaker yield minute gentleman from michigan kildee leader this issue tax compliance kildee madam speaker rise support this legislation presidential tax filings audit transparency act legislation ensures protect our tax system ensures fair transparent for all americans have heard purpose ways means committee investigation purpose this legislation ensure american above law even president united states but shockingly under former president irs was not examining president's tax returns required their own policy had for other presidents before since did not follow its own rules because this there are still glaring questions about whether former president was abiding our tax laws why needed information why need this legislation require irs examine presidential returns timely complete manner american people must have confidence our tax laws apply evenly justly everyone madam speaker thank chairman neal for his leadership this passing this will ensure integrity our tax system brady madam speaker include record article from yesterday's los angeles times confirming release tax returns does nothing evaluate irs auditing process advance any legitimate oversight goal from los angeles times dec 2022 column should congress post trump's tax returns publicly don't think nicholas goldberg donald trump should have released his tax returns when was running for president not doing was deceptive sleazy violation long-standing tradition fosters transparency honesty obviously hoped hide unfavorable information from voters despite don't believe house ways means committee should release his tax returns public now committee fought long battle all way supreme court obtain copies returns argued needed them evaluate effectiveness irs program audits tax filings presidents republicans squawked all way saying democrats who controlled committee were being disingenuous weren't seeking legitimate evaluation--they were just creating pretext get ahold trump's returns for humiliating public fishing expedition into what taxes had hadn't been paid courts ultimately ruled committee could have six years trump's federal tax returns battle ended last month but tuesday committee voted something goes well beyond what's necessary evaluate irs presidential audit program committee now going release trump's taxes publicly posting full returns minus certain identifiers like social security numbers bank account numbers for all see quickly too coming days before democrats control committee republicans jan why make returns public how does help congress figure out whether irs auditing process working how does further legitimate oversight goals committee answer doesn't turns out republicans are right this may first time since civil war correctly noted this politically motivated move release information might harm embarrass former president theory i'm all for embarrassing trump with these two caveats first one can embarrass trump more than embarrasses himself second he's entirely shameless doesn't really get embarrassed any normal sense word ex-president dishonest thug who needs called account for his misbehavior but this particular case think democrats are wrong for one thing releasing private tax returns probably won't shed much light anything new york times already received leaked details more than two decades trump's tax filings published long stories should've shocked world billionaire pays less federal taxes some years than trump paid federal income taxes all out years furthermore manhattan district attorney's office has many trump's tax returns well prosecutors can pursue cases using data uncover but main reason object posting returns worry--perhaps quaintly this day age--about continued politicization governmental processes continued breaking established norms this case making private tax filings public know i'll get thousand emails saying republicans wouldn't hesitate same we're civil respectful always play marquess queensberry rules while our political opponents continue their underhanded tricks will always beaten there's certainly some truth but there's truth flip side too nobody plays rules there will soon rules play when you're doing something sensitive politically explosive investigating former president--at tense time history when there's talk civil war violence rise bitter political partisanship smoldering--it makes sense careful respect established process honest possible refrain from unnecessary politicization not escalate conflict unnecessarily among other things posting trump's taxes seems likely result tit-for-tat posting other people's private tax returns will soon seeing hunter biden's tax returns web it'll also give republicans some basis for saying actually democrats who low when others high unsurprisingly committee vote

urge colleagues vote neal madam speaker former commissioner irs has indicated last hours had idea how actual audit president's forms played out not from from public record madam speaker yield 1\1/2 minutes gentleman from california panetta who has had profound interest this issue panetta madam speaker let start off expressing gratitude for chairman neal for his seriousness his sincerity his solemnity his leadership ways means committee way conducted this request release former president's tax returns writing this legislation before because him throughout this odyssey members ways means committee always knew felt gravity implications what meant release individual's tax returns fact prior this weekend which was prior review former president's tax returns admit had intent voting release them however changed changed once were able obtain returns based valid legislative purpose confirmed supreme court through returns see complete failure irs when comes their presidential audit program program absolutely necessary ensure world's most important public servant abiding law paying his her taxes like free from any conflicts interest but clearly irs doesn't appreciate nor does prioritize importance this program especially during last administration because applied former president not one audit was completed despite what president said american public why support this

pass h.r 9640 brady madam speaker yield myself seconds note every year president trump's tax returns are under audit madam speaker include record article explaining purpose taxpayer privacy law democrats have dismantled this week exposing all americans political attack via tax information from lawfare dec 2022 house democrats can release trump's tax returns but should daniel hemel now house committee has obtained access six years former president trump's tax returns congressional democrats face easy question harder one easy question whether matter law house ways means committee--which gained access former president's tax filings after supreme court dismissed trump's last-ditch bid block internal revenue service from handing over documents--can make trump's returns public before republicans take control chamber jan answer question straightforwardly yes harder question whether normative matter committee ought make trump's returns public waning weeks democratic majority one hand trump's tax filings should have seen light day long ago trump should have released his returns voluntarily--as every elected president since richard nixon has trump administration should have allowed irs hand president's tax returns over house ways means committee when panel's chair rep richard neal d-mass requested those documents april 2019 federal judiciary shouldn't have allowed trump stall release his returns for three half years through litigation other hand ways means committee has maintained throughout litigation over trump's tax returns--which culminated with last week's supreme court decision--that seeking documents part its plan review irs's presidential audit program presidential audit program procedure--mentioned irs manual but not codified any statute regulation--by which irs examines individual tax returns filed president vice president each year any review presidential audit program starts now ends when gop takes control house january would slapdash superficial democrats house ways means committee rushed release trump's returns lameduck session--without conducting comprehensive review presidential audit program promised--it would look like their stated motive for seeking documents was indeed trump has alleged pretextual fortunately senate finance committee--which will remain under democratic leadership next congress--has both resources apparent inclination conduct comprehensive review presidential audit program house democrats initially set out undertake even house ways means committee doesn't release trump's tax returns this month likely consequence not trump's returns will remain under wraps forever senate finance committee will able obtain returns itself committee then can release return information relevant its review presidential audit program page h9997 full disclosure i've been advocating for release president trump's tax information since april 2017 when suggested washington post op-ed yale law journal forum article new york could enact law requiring release trump's state tax filings i've advised state lawmakers new york strategies make trump's tax returns public i've criticized house ways means chairman neal for acting too slowly obtain trump's returns i'm apologist for trump's tax secrecy still it's important democrats house ways means committee remain true their word chairman neal said his committee needed trump's tax returns evaluate extent which irs audits enforces federal tax laws against president turn around now release trump's returns--outside context thorough evaluation irs's presidential audit program--would make stated rationale look much like head fake would seem especially gratuitous given senate finance committee stands ready willing able carry out its own review presidential audit program easy question can house democrats make trump's tax returns public law clear house ways means committee can now make trump's tax returns public majority committee members vote relevant statute section 6103(f internal revenue code instructs irs release otherwise confidential tax returns return information three congressional tax committees--the senate finance committee house ways means committee joint committee taxation--upon written request from chair any those panels statute also instructs irs release returns return information other congressional committees under narrower set circumstances key language regarding receiving committee's confidentiality obligations lies section 6103(f)(4 paragraph says any return return information obtained senate finance committee house ways means committee joint committee taxation may submitted committee senate house representatives both goes say any return return information obtained another committee may submitted committee senate house representatives both except any return return information which can associated with otherwise identify directly indirectly particular taxpayer shall furnished senate house representatives only when sitting closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents writing such disclosure emphasis added some textualist judges justices are fond latin phrase expressio unius est exclusio alterius expression one thing exclusion other but one doesn't need textualist--or classicist--to recognize importance contrast between two submission provisions absent taxpayer's consent other committees can submit returns full senate house only when sitting closed executive session senate finance committee house ways means committee joint committee taxation can submit returns full senate house without condition judge trevor mcfadden u.s district court for district columbia reached same conclusion his december 2021 decision rejecting trump's bid block irs from releasing his returns might not right wise publish returns mcfadden wrote but house ways means committee has right house ways means committee exercises right with respect trump's returns its action wouldn't unprecedented 2014 house ways means committee published return information regarding taxpayers part its investigation into allegations irs had discriminated against conservative nonprofit organizations seeking tax exempt status definitive scholarly treatment section 6103(f longtime university virginia law professor george yin who served chief staff joint committee taxation from 2003 2005 concludes choice allow three tax committees publish private tax information was conscious decision congress prior 1976 yin explains president--along with three congressional tax committees--had statutory authority make return information public 1976 amendment eliminated president's authority publicize return information but preserved power three tax committees congress doubt felt compelled 1976 preserve some outlet for congressional disclosures public yin writes was natural give this authority tax committees top all this speech debate clause immunizes lawmakers from liability for statements make committee house senate floor even weren't for section 6103(f)(4 ways means committee member could--without legal consequence--read trump's tax returns aloud line line with c-span cameras rolling but house democrats don't need rely constitutional super-immunity here relevant statutory provisions clearly empower ways means committee enter trump's tax returns into public domain hard question should house democrats make trump's tax returns public before delving into normative question whether house ways means committee ought publish trump's tax returns let's clear three points out way first presidents ought release their tax returns disclosure presidential tax returns helps dispel pernicious notion taxpaying only for little people disclosure also helps voters lawmakers evaluate presidential conflicts interest for example revealing whether presidents would benefit personally from their administrations tax proposals finally disclosure serves check improper presidential influence over irs virtue their position apex executive branch presidents are nation's tax enforcers-in-chief but are also taxpayers against whom federal tax laws may enforced disclosure helps reduce risk presidents will exploit their dual roles their own pecuniary advantage second trump administration should have allowed irs release trump's tax returns house ways means committee when chairman neal requested those returns april 2019 section 6103(f)'s instructions are clear upon written request from chairman committee ways means chair other congressional tax panels treasury secretary irs commissioner secretary's delegee shall furnish such committee with any return return information specified such request emphasis added statute makes exception for cases which disclosure might embarrass president while case law suggests executive branch may reject information request from congress request does not further legitimate task congress neal's april 2019 request manifestly stated legitimate basis his committee could conduct oversight irs's presidential audit program needed consider legislative reforms related presidential audits third litigation over neal's april 2019 request shouldn't have dragged for long did was nearly three half years ago--in july 2019--when house ways means committee first asked d.c federal district court order irs hand over trump's returns lengthy delay resolving litigation meant trump could effectively evade congressional oversight presidential audit program for duration his term fault for delay lies feet multiple people-and neal himself bears some culpability for waiting until april 2019 submit his request until july 2019 file his lawsuit rather than seeking returns immediately after democrats took control house january year however one allocates blame though shouldn't take three half years for federal courts confirm word shall section 6103(f really means shall but here are december 2022 over course three-and-a-half-year fight over trump's returns neal other members house ways means committee made several statements constrain their options now initial april 2019 letter requesting trump's returns neal said his committee needed documents determine scope irs's audit president whether includes review underlying business activities required reported individual income tax return recently last month ways means committee told supreme court its document request well-tailored illuminating how irs conducted any audits trump while was president whether reforms are needed enhance irs's ability audit presidents future throughout litigation neal house ways means committee adamantly denied request driven exposure solely for sake exposure trump had argued june 2021 letter treasury secretary janet yellen irs commissioner charles rettig neal put succinctly there have been claims''--including from trump himself--``that true sole purpose committee's inquiry here expose president trump's tax returns these claims are wrong plainly house ways means committee not going able carry out thorough evaluation irs presidential audit program four half weeks between now gop takeover committee's document request extensive has asked for returns filed trump seven his business entities from tax years 2015 through status report for each audit administrative files such examiner workpapers associated with each trump returns with competing demands for attention committee members staffers including dec deadline avert government shutdown reviewing those documents may consume better part next four half weeks but even after committee reviews all those documents will still need more information before can complete comprehensive assessment presidential audit program has promised for example committee will need know how irs's handling items trump's tax returns compares service's treatment similar items returns filed other high-net-worth business owners who weren't president united page h9998 states irs allowed trump claim inflated charitable contribution deduction for conservation easement his golf course westchester county new york because examiners gave special treatment trump because service generally lacks resources challenge conservation easement appraisals committee also will likely need hear testimony from irs examiners involved presidential audit program did personally experience improper political influence committee will need compare audits trump's returns audits other presidents vice presidents for example when joe biden became president did irs back review biden's aggressive use self-employment tax loophole save hundreds thousands dollars his his spouse jill's 2017 2018 returns while biden--unlike trump--released his returns voluntarily don't know what happened those filings after entered irs audit vortex sure house ways means committee could begin its review presidential audit program now then release everything has when clock strikes noon jan like test-taking student who drops her pencil mid sentence when proctor says time's trump's tax returns additional information collected committee would then enter public domain allowing journalists others probe further neal house ways means committee had said all along their purpose was vindicate principle presidential tax transparency using powers their disposal under section 6103(f perhaps course action would justified indeed releasing trump's tax returns for sake releasing trump's tax returns might not such bad thing--given all arguments for presidential tax transparency outlined above yet neal house ways means committee insisted all along their motive was not exposure for sake exposure was strategically wise thing say for litigation purposes but statement circumscribes what can least should next neal house ways means committee would undermine their own credibility--and could seen hoodwinking courts public--if proceeded release returns outside context comprehensive review presidential audit program can senate take over enter stage left senate finance committee while republicans who take control house ways means committee january are exceedingly unlikely continue democrats inquiry senate finance committee under leadership chairman ron wyden d-ore quite capable conducting comprehensive review presidential audit program house democrats won't able complete wyden will have send his own written request irs for trump's returns but this shouldn't much more than formality wyden could send request this morning irs could send documents back this afternoon there requirement wyden irs even inform trump request before irs fulfills time trump could file lawsuit stop irs from complying wyden already would have documents hand any event lawsuit trump stop irs from fulfilling wyden's request would frivolous given d.c circuit's decision resolving issue house litigation--and almost certainly would dismissed much more quickly than trump's earlier bid block house section 6103(f)(4 also allows neal chair house ways means committee appoint agents examine returns has obtained through his request theory neal could appoint senate finance committee staffers--or chairman wyden himself--as house committee's agents but neal's gop successor house ways means chair could revoke appointment ending senate's inquiry midstream thus better course action clearly for wyden issue his own written request for returns senate finance committee's behalf sum even window closes for house ways means committee conduct comprehensive review presidential audit program congress still can comb through trump's tax returns determine whether irs fairly fully audited former president would different chamber congress--the senate not house--but trump would nonetheless subject legislative branch scrutiny hopefully house democrats will recognize deferring their senate colleagues preferable reneging their own word publishing trump's returns outside context presidential audit program review promised instead house democrats release returns now trump his supporters will charge democrats with duplicity for saying one thing litigation doing another thing afterward--and charge won't entirely baseless would perversely allow trump transform matter his tax returns from political vulnerability for him potential liability for democrats beyond questions political strategy promise-keeping is--of course--an important value itself yes presidents should release their tax returns but doesn't release house democrats from avowals about their motives have made since 2019 their last weeks majority house democrats have another opportunity demonstrate why deserve nation's trust should seize it--even means those who have been waiting for years know what's buried trump's tax returns might have wait little longer brady madam speaker reserve balance time time 1015 neal madam speaker yield 1\1/2 minutes gentleman from nevada horsford who has been leader

seconds gentlewoman from texas jackson lee madam speaker know see them all time madam speaker addition dereliction regarding audit donald trump have heard are schoolteacher are audited want say irs commissioner are derelict your duties are derelict your sensitivity constituents calls from members are derelict your duty what are supposed related president united states not only because was president but because was individual who continued ignore laws land said today was day truth this holiday season this legislation will bring truth respect let's see those tax returns let irs its job behalf american people madam speaker rise strong support h.r 9640 presidential tax filings audit transparency act 2022 this legislation arose necessity when ways means committee investigated irs's execution its mandate audit taxes sitting president found during trump administration irs had been serious dereliction its duty audit taxes donald trump when had been president this was especially troubling because based publicly known commonly held information donald trump's activities investments presented wide range questionable potentially problematic tax issues far greater degree than any previous president donald trump's taxes are prototypical example why policy was established 1970s required irs audit taxes sitting president yet ways means committee found did not happen either never being initiated never being completed leads obvious question why did irs simply forget did someone misplace his tax returns did auditor presidential tax returns retire while don't know exact answer irs's failure conduct its statutorily mandated audit president's taxes raises possibility nefarious reason for failure page h10000 given well-documented extensive repeated malfeasance was endemic presidency donald trump--including all evidence presented during his two impeachment trials his attempt obstruct effectuation election subvert constitution exposed january 6th select committee--it obvious trump had little interest personally adhering law because congress would naive believe irs's failure audit trump's taxes was merely administerial error whether failure was due specific instruction was transmitted directly irs leadership implied directive was recognized possibly some other means observing conveying trump's wishes would foolish ignore possibility president who flouted law with impunity many occasions had instead total contrast insisted strict adherence law connection audit his personal taxes his views played part failure irs audit his taxes this obvious observation accentuated trump's public statements displaying his antipathy paying his fair share federal taxes perhaps most resoundingly during 2016 debate said paying nothing federal taxes over series years makes smart all this pertinent background underscores obvious basis for legislation are now considering congress must ensure failure irs audit sitting president's taxes never happens again this bill codifies requirement irs conduct complete audit sitting president's taxes each year publicly disclose certain information about its findings bill also requires irs audit any additional filing former president relates year which had been office since responsibility congress ensure tax code administered fairly for every american especially important congress apply most powerful american any given time president united states fairness requires even-handed application law everyone including those with most influence over our governmental institutions failure adhere this precept would subordinate public confidence our democracy whims person who presides over entire executive branch our government failure abide fairness enforcement our tax code would negate fairness fundamental american principle failure apply tax code president even-handed manner just like applies other americans would assert acquiescence justice rule law machiavellian autocratic narcissistic personal interests personal power may how things work countries run monarchs but that's not how united states works fact antithetical every stroke quill composed our constitution madam speaker strongly support this legislation because necessary appropriate effectuates bedrock american principles urge all colleagues vote yes this bill empower irs its job--free fear favor--and remind every future president subordinate constitution rule law just like every other person our country speaker pro tempore members are reminded address their remarks chair not perceived viewing audience brady madam speaker yield

democrats immediately try force president trump release his tax returns take back house november exposing true purpose this effort from bloomberg government oct 2018 chronicle pelosi trump's tax returns are fair game democrats house john wildermuth expect democrats immediately try force president trump release his tax returns take back house november minority leader nancy pelosi said wednesday demanding president's tax returns one first things we'd do--that's easiest thing world that's nothing pelosi told chronicle's editorial board hour-long interview although 1924 provision internal revenue code gives certain congressional committees right request release--the tax records even president it's unlikely trump would surrender those documents without all-out legal battle has refused release his returns since announced was running for president arguing first was being audited later voters don't care gop-led congress has joined keeping those records private regularly voting down democratic efforts make trump turn them over forcing trump release his returns would not necessarily make them public but would allow democratic-run congressional committee decide whether there information those returns needs investigated whether happens hinges democrats winning house senate with nov election less than four weeks away pelosi sounded confident about both house democrats chances her own political future believe would election was today said although more than democratic candidates have said wouldn't vote for pelosi lead house san francisco democrat said believe will speaker releasing president's tax returns congressional committee would not revenge for way trump gop leaders have treated democratic minority for past two years but simple matter oversight congress equal body government pelosi said have have truth said payback isn't going part democratic-led house pelosi promised pushing back against what called pound flesh crowd democrats eager repay republicans for every political slight attack since trump was elected will seek bipartisanship where can pelosi said one reasons should we're not like them we're not going like them democratic leader also says doesn't have much choice matter what happens election day trump still going president will have work with him need get signature which requires some bipartisanship some common ground pelosi said which admitted wasn't always easy probably more than most people respect office serves probably more than does said but president--we have find our common ground want get results for american people but that's going mean discussions compromise not surrender pelosi said democrats will never negotiate away our values said pelosi confident there are areas where democrats can reach agreement with trump republicans did when republican george bush was president despite disputes over iraq war other issues worked together disagree agreed that's marketplace ideas live said areas where there could common ground include national infrastructure improvements plan for dreamers undocumented residents who arrived this country page h10001 minors ways curb gun violence pelosi said there's also public support for efforts allow department health human services negotiate for lower drug prices added pelosi also weighed some local issues saying supported san francisco's efforts establish safe injection site for drug users something gov jerry brown vetoed last month also backed changes federal marijuana laws although admitted don't see this president signing any such thing but those concerns are far from top democrats to-do list take back house first order business economic security america's working families--that what people care about pelosi said for pelosi concern connects directly with san francisco's proposition which would tax large companies raise estimated 300 million year for homeless programs pelosi said supports measure because it's something city needs acknowledged opposition from her political ally mayor london breed who has said before city pours millions dollars more into homeless programs san franciscans deserve accountability for money are already paying don't disagree with mayor there should accountability there should plan about how use funds pelosi said have great confidence mayor can handle prop wins efforts deal with social problems like homelessness hunger housing insecurity require new vision from congress said have think different way about when think big have put our hands pockets where money pelosi said homelessness

capitol sent donald trump stop transfer power today colleague from california lofgren our witnesses will detail select committee's findings these matters but first will recognize our distinguished vice chair cheney wyoming for any opening statement would care offer vice chair cheney thank very much chairman last week chairman noted our committee began outlining 7-part plan--overseen president trump--to overturn election today will begin looking initial part plan president trump's effort convince millions americans election was stolen from him overwhelming fraud federal court has already reviewed elements committee's evidence this point said this months following election numerous credible sources--from president's inner circle agency leadership statisticians--informed president trump eastman there was evidence election fraud sufficient overturn presidential election court's opinion methodically documents each principal reasons for conclusion would urge all those watching read today will begin show american people some our evidence today will hear much more from former attorney general bill barr's recorded testimony will hear greater detail what others department told president trump his claims election fraud were nonsense will also hear much more from president trump's own campaign experts who had also concluded his fraud claims could not supported let focus briefly just three points now first will hear first-hand testimony president's campaign advisors urged him await counting votes not declare victory election night president understood even before election many more biden voters had voted mail because president trump ignored advice his campaign experts told his supporters only vote person donald trump knew before election counting those mail-in ballots several states would not begin until late day would not complete for multiple days this was expected reported widely known will also hear testimony president trump rejected advice his campaign experts election night instead followed course recommended apparently inebriated rudy giuliani just claim insist vote counting stop falsely claim everything was fraudulent falsely told american people election was not legitimate his words major fraud millions americans believed him second pay attention what donald trump his legal team said repeatedly about dominion voting machines--far-flung conspiracies with deceased venezuelan communist allegedly pulling strings this was complete nonsense bill barr said president trump's own campaign advisors his department justice his cybersecurity experts all told him same thing here for example white house lawyer eric herschmann his view was shared many trump team whom interviewed herschmann thought dominion stuff was--i never saw any evidence whatsoever sustain those allegations vice chair cheney third mike pence's staff started get sense for what donald trump had planned for january 6th called campaign experts give them briefing election fraud all other election claims january 2nd general counsel trump campaign matthew morgan--this campaign's chief lawyer--summarized what campaign had concluded weeks earlier none arguments about fraud anything else could actually change outcome election morgan generally discussed topic was whether fraud maladministration abuse irregularities aggregated read most favorably campaign would outcome determinative think everyone's assessment room least amongst staff marc short myself greg jacob was was not sufficient outcome determinative vice chair cheney obvious this was before attack capitol trump campaign legal team knew there was legitimate argument--fraud irregularities anything--to overturn election yet president trump went ahead with his plans for january 6th anyways chairman hundreds our countrymen have faced criminal charges--many are serving criminal sentences--because believed what donald trump said about election acted came washington his request marched capitol his request hundreds them besieged invaded building heart our constitutional republic one conservative editorial board put recently trump betrayed his supporters conning them january 6th still doing another conservative editorial board has long supported president trump said last week donald trump won't stop insisting was stolen even though has offered proof true this donald trump now clings more fantastical theories such dinesh d'souza's debunked 2000 mules even recounts arizona georgia wisconsin confirm trump those are correct conclusions draw from evidence gathered this committee have much

coming out george can just describe atmosphere what were people expecting night when got white house miller think there was--typically for people who show there election night it's going self-select more positive environment think people were little bit nervous not knowing what was going happen with red wave red mirage debate was being carried out fox news anchor bret baier fox news decision desk

people mentioned stepien meadows anyone else about whether president should make any sort speech election night giuliani mean spoke president may have been present but president--spoke president several times night miller there were suggestions believe was mayor giuliani declare victory say outright stepien was far too early making any calls like ballots--ballots were still being counted ballots were still going counted for days was far too early making any proclamation like miller remember saying i--to best memory was saying should not declare victory until had better sense numbers george okay can more specific about conversation particular what mayor giuliani said your response then anybody else room's response miller think effectively mayor giuliani was saying they're stealing from where'd all votes come from need say essentially anyone who didn't agree with position was being weak heaphy what was your view time what should shouldn't say trump don't know had firm view what should say circumstance results were still being counted was becoming clear race would not called election night stepien belief recommendation was say votes are still being counted it's too early

election stirewalt joseph robinette biden great state delaware chairman thompson thank bottom line have had election trump but refused accept results democratic process pursuant section 5(c)(8 house resolution 503 now recognize gentlewoman from california lofgren for questions lofgren well thank thank chairman stirewalt would like explain term was thrown around lot during election called red mirage what does mean stirewalt years let's say americans have increasingly chosen vote mail early absentee democrats prefer method voting more than republicans basically every election republicans election day democrats early vote then wait start counting depends which ones count first but usually election day votes get counted first see republicans shoot ahead then process baling binding unbinding all those mail votes some states like pennsylvania refused count votes first have wait for all come every election certainly national election expect see republican with lead but it's not really lead when put together jigsaw puzzle doesn't matter which piece put first ends with same image for who cares but that's because candidate had ever tried avail themself this quirk election counting system had gone pains--and i'm proud pains went to--to make sure were informing viewers this was going happen because trump campaign president had made clear were going try exploit this anomaly knew was going bigger because percentage early votes was higher right went from about percent votes being early absentee because pandemic increased about percent knew would longer knew would more wanted keep telling viewers hey look number see here sort irrelevant because it's only small percentage these votes lofgren this red mirage that's really what expected happen election night stirewalt happens every time lofgren thank stirewalt now i'd like play clip attorney general bill barr who also explains what was expected happen election night attorney general barr right out box election night president claimed there was major fraud underway mean this happened far could tell before there was actually any potential looking evidence seemed based dynamic that--that end evening lot democratic votes came which changed vote counts certain states seemed basis for this broad claim there was major fraud didn't think much because people had been talking for weeks everyone understood for weeks was going what happened election night lofgren stepien obviously could not with today it's proper for him with his wife welcome their child but also had discussions with president about red mirage--that would long night early votes would favor him but lots more votes would counted over course night days after let's play clip from our interview with stepien stepien i--i recounted back conversation with him which said--just like said 2016 was going long night i--i told him know there were--it was going a--a process again know early returns are going know positive then we're gonna know watching returns of--of ballots know rolled thereafter george fair say you're trying present a--what thought would realistic picture what might happen over course night being election night stepien night days followed yeah i--i--i always--i always know always told president truth know i--i know think expected from told him was going process was going know--you know we're gonna have wait see how this turned out i--i--just like did 2016 did same thing lofgren let's watch short clip president trump speaking after received information from his campaign advisors president trump want all voting stop don't want them find any ballots o'clock morning add them list lofgren when former president trump said contradicted what his advisors had warned would happen all know mail-in ballots played important role election however president trump continuously discouraged mail-in voting stepien was concerned about president's position mail-in voting summer met with president trump along with house minority leader kevin mccarthy let's play clip stepien meeting was had particular invited kevin mccarthy join meeting being like mind issue with which made our case for--for why believed mail-in balloting--mail-in voting not bad thing for his campaign but know the--the president's mind was made understand know how many times know well particular topic heaphy yeah understand tell little bit more about argument mccarthy made president meeting why wasn't bad thing mail-in voting was available stepien largely two pillars argument both which i've previously mentioned one know leaving good deal chance pushing urging your voters vote only election day leaves lot chance that's--that's also previously mentioned fact trump campaign republican national committee republican party had advantage of--of grassroots workers volunteers ground would allow know an--an advantage enhance return rates of--of ballots were mailed those were two pillars argument heaphy see what anything recall representative mccarthy saying during meeting stepien were--we were echoing same argument mean his--his words echoed--echoed mine vice versa those--on those two topics lofgren stirewalt were decision desk fox news election night called arizona early for president biden which was controversial how did make call where did think race stood early hours next day stirewalt well was really controversial our competitors who beat badly making correct call first our decision desk was best business was very proud part because had partnered with associated press national opinion research center university chicago thanks colleague friend arnon mishkin had built wonderful device for forecasting outcomes election had different set data than our competitors did had more research had better system had great team what you're waiting see actual votes match with expectations poll real votes are testing quality your poll targeted precincts targeted places let tell our poll arizona was beautiful was doing just what wanted was cooking just right some point--and forget exactly who--but some point became clear arizona was getting ready make call around know boss bill sammon said we're not making any call until everybody says yes because was always our policy unanimity have understand this room have know best--people from academia democrats republicans broad cross-section people who had worked together for decade who were really serious about this stuff knew would consequential call because was one five states really mattered right wisconsin michigan pennsylvania georgia arizona were ones were watching knew would significant call any one those five but already knew trump's chances were very small getting smaller based what had seen were able make call early were able beat competition looked around room everybody says yea time found out how much everybody was freaking out losing their minds over this call were already trying call next state had already moved were georgia were north carolina were looking these other states thought was--we were pleased but not surprised lofgren see know after election november 7th your judgment what were chances president trump winning election stirewalt after point lofgren yes stirewalt none mean guess could--it's always possible could have know truckload ballots found somewhere suppose but once get into this space know ahead today thought about what are largest margins could ever overturned recount normal kind of--the kind stuff heard mike pence talking about sounding like normal republican night when said know we'll keep every challenge nothing like recount you're talking about hundreds votes when think about calling race one things would think about outside margin recount when think about margin think about modern history you're talking about 1,000 votes 1,500 votes way way outside normally you're talking about hundreds votes maybe 300 votes are going change idea through any normal process any these states--remember had thrice right needed three these states change order mean you're infinite--you're better off play powerball than have come lofgren november 7th other major news outlets called race for president biden now stepien told committee thought odds were--and this quote very very very bleak held meeting with president same day let's show video clip stepien with each day wore mean the--the trajectory race know election night trump ahead in--in many states as--as week wore third became fourth became fifth forth vote-by-mail ballots were tabulated know trump's trump's lead know grew more narrow and--and in--and some places biden surpassed know trump in--in vote totals as--as week wore paid attention those numbers every single--multiple times day know internally know i--i was feeling less confident for sure george what was your view state election point stepien know very very very bleak know i--i--i--we--we told him know group went over there outlined know belief in--in--in chances for success this point then pegged know maybe--maybe percent based recounts were--that know either were automatically initiated or--or--or could be--could initiated based know realistic legal challenges not all legal challenges eventually were pursued but know was know belief was very very--i mean percent not very good optimistic outlook lofgren now president trump others continued claim election was stolen there were lawyers who were part campaign campaign lawyers who were responsible for investigating fraud claims includes alex cannon who could not validate claims were being made including those being made president let's roll video george this email it's two emails actually first from alex cannon faith mcpherson then forward email mark meadows justin clark jason miller subject being federal voters look original email there says bill completed analysis requested assume that's about arizona because un--the substantial uncertainty surrounding databases this highly unreliable way identify ineligible voters can explain task gave cannon for this arizona analysis stepien sure previously described some frustration with some the--the claims people would throw president trump regarding know know need look this know this happened this state happened state would know--those would flow to--to--to look into i--i talked about before think george yep stepien know this example recall--i recall arizona someone had thrown out believe this claim there were thousands illegal citizens people not eligible vote having cast their ballots arizona someone had thrown out claim president trump with know margins being close were previously described know could potentially matter this--this wild claim thrown out which know its face didn't seem know realistic possible asked alex look the--you know the--the claim i--i haven't read his full email but recall response reality was not illegal citizens voting election think was like overseas voters voting election i--i--so obviously know people who were eligible vote lofgren when these findings were passed chain president trump became frustrated replaced campaign's legal team let's play clip stepien know think president was during second week where things like displayed were occurring where was know growing increasingly unhappy with know his team know less because was less involved this point but still growing increasingly unhappy with justin clark kind-of know--you know paved way for know justin moved out mayor giuliani moved person charge know legal side campaign for all intents purposes campaign point lofgren now when stepien became campaign manager was second trump campaign manager for race there were only about 115 days until election day let's play video stepien inherited campaign was--the day was hired was believe president trump's low point daily average polling against president biden was--it was campaign low point polls was structurally fiscally deficient know i--you know there was great deal wrong with campaign in--in both those--in--in both those areas most day was spent fixing what--and think took over with 115 days left campaign most time was spent fixing things could fixed with 115 days left campaign lofgren now stepien has been campaign field for long time worked for lots different candidates campaigns testified this committee about his concerns given claims giuliani powell their team were making publicly let's play clip heaphy okay was important for stepien sort-of pull back just for your own professional reputation didn't want associated with some what were hearing from giuliani team others that--that sort-of stepped wake your departure stepien didn't mind being categorized there were two groups them called them kind-of team rudy's team i--i didn't mind being characterized being part team normal as--as reporters know kind-of started around point time know said know hours ago early know i've i've been doing this for long time years i've spanned know political ideologies from trump mccain bush christie know know can work under lot circumstances for lot varied know candidates politicians but situation where think along way i've built pretty good--i hope good reputation for being honest and--and professional i--i didn't think what was happening was necessarily honest professional point time again led stepping away lofgren president did get rid team normal i'd like play clip showing president found people needed perpetuate his claims fraud giuliani saw big truck bringing 100,000 ballots garbage cans wastepaper baskets cardboard boxes shopping baskets every single one them was for biden because were being notified smartmatic frankfurt biden was way behind better come with lot more ballots can prove every single thing just said gave paper ballots could probably turn around each one these states i'm absolutely convinced you--if let examine each one those ballots i'd pull out enough were fraudulent would shake hell out country powell can set run algorithm probably ran all over country take certain percentage votes from president trump flip them president biden which might never have uncovered had votes for president trump not been overwhelming many these states broke algorithm remember one things mark said some point was can't show actual vote was flipped which found time remarkable assertion because--because don't have have gun see body lying floor bleeding out with five bullet holes was killed gun herschmann what were proposing thought was nuts know theory was also completely nuts right mean was combination italians germans mean different things have been floating around who was involved remember hugo chavez venezuelans has affidavit from somebody who says wrote software in--and something with philippines just all over radar heaphy did ever share kushner your view giuliani did ever share your perspective about him with president kushner guess--yes heaphy tell what said kushner well basically not approach would take was heaphy okay and--and how did react how did president trump react when shared view with him kushner said know i--i have confidence rudy morgan think had conversations with probably all our counsel who were signed assist election day disengaged with campaign general consensus was law firms were not comfortable making arguments rudy giuliani was making publicly seem recall had similar conversation with most all them attorney general barr made clear did not agree with idea saying election was stolen putting out this stuff which told president was bullshit know didn't want part that's one reasons went into deciding leave when did lofgren even sidney powell defending herself defamation lawsuit brought dominion voting systems argued reasonable person would conclude her statements were truly statements fact chairman yield back chairman thompson thank witness for joining today first panel now dismissed without objection chair recognizes gentlewoman from california lofgren lofgren thank chairman last week presented testimony former attorney general bill barr who testified before this committee today present additional evidence including his testimony former president trump started making claims election fraud immediately after election barr concluded claims were untrue now due length attorney general barr's testimony we're only going include relevant portions hearing today let's play video attorney general barr department fact when received specific credible allegations fraud made effort look into these satisfy ourselves were without merit and--and was posture trying figure out--there was avalanche all these allegations fraud built over number days was like playing whac-a-mole because something would come out one day then next day would another issue also was influenced fact all early claims understood on--were--were completely bogus silly usually based complete misinformation i--i didn't consider quality claims right out box give any know feeling there was really substance here lofgren for first time since election attorney general spoke personally with president november 23rd this was white house let's play video please attorney general barr november 23rd i--i hadn't spoken president since election fact said since middle october roughly was little--getting awkward because obviously had election hadn't said anything him cipollone said know think it's time come over here came over meet with president oval office and--and meadows were--and cipollone were there president and--and this leading this conversation with kushner president said there had been major fraud soon facts were out results election would reversed went on--on this for quite while prone then got something was expecting which say apparently department justice doesn't think has role looking into these fraud claims said know has campaign raises with state department doesn't take sides elections department not extension of--of your legal team our role investigate fraud if--and we'll look something it's--if it's specific credible could have affected outcome election and--and we're doing it's just not--they're not they're just not meritorious they're not pan--panning out walked out oval office jared was there with dan scavino who ran his--ran president's social media who thought was reasonable guy believe reasonable guy said how long is--how long going carry with this stolen election stuff where this going time meadows had caught with and--leaving office caught and--and said that--he said look i--i think he's becoming more realistic knows there's limit how far can take this then jared said know yeah we're working this we're working lofgren even after his attorney general told him his claims election fraud were false president trump continued promote these claims attorney general barr felt things continued deteriorate between 23rd weekend 29th then november 29th appeared maria bartiromo's show sunday futures believe was said department was missing action president trump well had glitches where moved thousands votes from account biden's account these are glitches they're not glitches they're theft they're fraud absolute fraud this election was over then did dumps call them dumps--big massive dumps michigan pennsylvania all over how fbi department justice--i don't know maybe they're involved but how people are allowed get away from this stuff--with this stuff unbelievable lofgren now spurred what saw barr told associated press december 1st there was evidence election fraud immediately after attorney general barr's statement went public trump berated nearly fired barr but barr persisted telling president there was evidence support fraud claims attorney general barr this got under skin but also felt was time for say something on--i had--so set lunch with reporter mike balsamo told him lunch--i made statement date have not seen fraud scale could have effected different outcome election had later meeting scheduled white house o'clock with meadows this was previously scheduled knew this was gonna come went over there told secretary thought would probably fired told not to--to home laughter]--i mean not back office said might have pack for when got over there met with chief staff said president was angry didn't really go--get into issue fraud then went pat cipollone's office were talking with each other word came down wanted both oval president was mad i've ever seen him was trying control himself president said well this know killing didn't have say this must have said this because hate trump hate trump then raised the--the big vote dump called detroit know said people saw boxes coming counting station all hours morning forth explained him i--at point knew exact number precincts for detroit think was 630-something said president there are 630 precincts detroit unlike elsewhere state centralize counting process they're not counted each precinct they're moved counting stations normal process would involve boxes coming all different hours there's nothing--and said did anyone point out you--did all people complaining about point out actually did better detroit than did--you did last time mean there's indication fraud detroit told him stuff his people were shoveling out public were bull--was bullshit mean claims fraud were bullshit know was indignant about reiterated they've wasted whole month these claims--on dominion voting machines were idiotic claims specifically raised dominion voting machines which found among most disturbing allegations disturbing sense saw absolutely zero basis for allegations but were made such sensational way obviously were influencing lot people--members public--that there was this systemic corruption system their votes didn't count these machines controlled somebody else were actually determining which was complete nonsense was being laid out there told them was--it was crazy stuff were wasting their time was doing great grave disservice country lofgren okay very next day president released video rehashing some very same claims his chief law enforcement officer had told him were nonsense president trump here's example this michigan 6:31 morning vote dump 149,772 votes came unexpectedly were winning lot batch was received horror have company that's very suspect its name dominion with turn dial change chip can press button for trump vote goes biden what kind system this lofgren barr again told president there was nothing these claims december 14th attorney general barr when walked sat down went off monologue saying there was now definitive evidence involving fraud through dominion machines report had been prepared very reputable cybersecurity firm which identified allied security operations group held report had--and then asked copy made for while copy was being made said know this absolute proof dominion machines were rigged report means going have second term then gave copy report talked more more about sat there flipping through poor report looking through frank looked very amateurish didn't have credentials people involved but didn't see any real qualifications statements were made very conclusory like this--these machines were designed know engage fraud something effect but didn't see any supporting information for was somewhat demoralized because thought boy really believes this stuff has know contact with--with--he's become detached from reality really believes this stuff other hand know when went into this would know tell him how crazy some these allegations were there was never--there was never indication interest what actual facts were opinion then opinion now election was not stolen fraud haven't seen anything since election changes mind including 2000 mules movie laughter lofgren maybe can assess 2000 mules people are talking about attorney general barr well mean just nutshell know just think gbi was unimpressed with was similarly unimpressed with because think you--because was holding fire see what photographic evidence was because thought well hell have lot photographs same person dumping lot ballots different boxes know that's hard explain wanted see what photographic evidence was but cell phone data singularly unimpressive mean basically take million cell phones and--and figure out where are physically big city like atlanta wherever just definition you're going find many hundreds them have passed spent time vicinity these boxes premise know about know five boxes whatever was know that's mule just indefensible if--by definition you're going have lot--hundreds this mean when saw one contractor said figured out our truck alone would account for six cell phone signals this was know some kind contractor know our route would take these things regular basis i--but then when movie came out know think photographic evidence was completely lack--i mean was--there was little bit but was lacking know didn't--it didn't establish wide-spread illegal harvesting other thing people don't understand it's not clear even can show harvesting changes the--the results election courts are not going throw out votes then figure out what votes were harvested throw them out you'd still burden challenging party show illegal votes were cast votes were result undue influence bribes there was really know person was non compos mentis but absent evidence just didn't see courts throwing out votes anyway felt before election was possible talk sense president while sometimes had engage big wrestling match with him then was possible keep things track but was--felt after election didn't seem listening didn't think was know was inclined not stay around wasn't listening advice from his other cabinet secretaries lofgren december 14th barr quit now attorney general wasn't only person who told president his claims were false other officials close advisors told him same thing acting attorney general rosen rather than try address counterfactual hypothetical let just say there were instances where president would say people are telling this heard this saw television know this--this impropriety atlanta pennsylvania something were position say our people already looked know you're getting bad information that--that's not correct it's been demonstrated incorrect from our point view had been debunked lyons month-and-a-half after election day meeting know various allegations fraud were discussed know eric pat didn't know--told group president included none those allegations had been substantiated point where could basis for any litigation challenge election lofgren president trump's own vice president his top advisors also knew there wasn't evidence support claims president was making harris anyone else other than meadows who asked about status outside your legal group know morgan others mentioned anyone else who asked status what were finding your assessment cannon yes sir harris who's cannon peter navarro harris when did talk navarro cannon mid-november harris around same time meadows cannon yes sir harris tell about conversation cannon recall him asking questions about dominion maybe some other categories allegations voter fraud remember telling him didn't believe dominion allegations because thought hand recount georgia would resolve any issues with technology problem with dominion dominion flipping votes mentioned time cisa chris krebs had recently released report saying election was secure believe navarro accused being agent deep state working with chris krebs against president never took another phone call from navarro harris anyone else besides meadows navarro hershman had discussions with inquiring about what were finding your review allegations were pouring cannon believe had about 15-second conversation with vice president about well harris when was cannon during one visits white house don't know which one think was first one november was--i had met him briefly campaign remembered saw asked what was doing campaign told him were looking into some issues related voter fraud asked don't remember his exact words but asked were finding anything said didn't believe were finding--or was not personally finding--anything sufficient alter results election he--he thanked was our interaction lofgren later hearing you'll hear live testimony from former acting deputy attorney general department justice rich donoghue but now would like play portion his testimony acting deputy attorney general donoghue tried again put this perspective try put very clear terms president said something effect sir we've done dozens investigations hundreds interviews major allegations are not supported evidence developed we've looked georgia pennsylvania michigan nevada we're doing our job much info you're getting false then went into for instance this thing from michigan--this report about percent error rate reality was only 0.0063 percent error rate less than 1-in-15,000 president accepted said okay fine but what about others again this gets back point there were many these allegations when gave him very direct answer one them wouldn't fight but would move another allegation then talked about--a little bit about pennsylvania truck driver this another allegation had come this claim was truck driver who believed perhaps honestly had transported entire tractor trailer truck full ballots from new york pennsylvania this was again out there public discussed essentially said look looked allegation looked both ends both people who load truck people unload truck allegation was not supported evidence again said okay''--then said note didn't mention one what about others said okay well with regard georgia looked tape interviewed witnesses there suitcase president kept fixating this suitcase supposedly had fraudulent ballots suitcase was rolled out from under table said sir there suitcase can watch video over over there suitcase there wheeled bin where carry ballots that's just how move ballots around facility there's nothing suspicious about all told him there was multiple scanning ballots one--one part allegation was were taking one ballot scanning through three four five times rack votes presumably for vice president biden told him video did not support then went off double voting--the top next page said dead people are voting indians are getting paid vote meant people native american reservations said there's lots fraud going here told him flat out much information he's getting false and/or

barr had asked had seen certain videotape was being reported news where giuliani senate subcommittee hearing was held day before december 3rd showed videotape purportedly--a security tape state farm arena atlanta which also fulton county city atlanta--oh sorry city of--yes time barr asked me--he had made public statement had not seen any wide-spread election fraud would question outcome election because videotape serious allegation giuliani was making with respect suitcase full ballots purported video asked find out what could about because had envisioned some days after our call was going white house for meeting then issue might come asked make priority get bottom of--to try substantiate allegation made giuliani lofgren thank understand georgia secretary state's office investigated those state farm arena allegations didn't find any evidence fraud what did find when your office conducted its own investigation pak found suitcase full ballots alleged black suitcase was being seen pulled from under table was actually official lockbox where ballots were kept safe found out there was mistake terms misunderstanding were done counting ballots tallying ballots for night partisan watchers were assigned each respective parties were announced home but once realized mistake someone from secretary state's office had indicated we're not done for night need ahead continue counting once packed lockbox full ballots brought back official ballot box again continued tally ballots from that--from lockbox unfortunately during senate hearing giuliani only played clip showed them pulling out official ballot box from under table referring smoking gun fraud fulton county but actuality review entire video showed was actually official ballot box was kept underneath tables then saw them pack because announcement thought were done for night then once announcement was made should continue counting brought ballot box back out continued count interviewed--the fbi interviewed individuals are depicted videos purportedly were double triple-counting ballots determined nothing irregular happened counting allegations made giuliani were false lofgren thank very much would like play again testimony from donoghue who appeared before committee before today vice chair cheney donoghue you--we talked some length about whether not white house president was informed about antrim report results investigations interviews have gone fulton county how would those results have been communicated white house president acting deputy attorney general donoghue don't know how were initially communicated know came subsequent conversations with president dag rosen essentially told him looked into it's just not true vice chair cheney okay was--he was informed acting deputy attorney general donoghue told president myself several times several conversations these allegations about ballots being smuggled suitcase run through machine several times was not true--that looked looked video interviewed witnesses was not true lofgren pak after left u.s attorney's office january 2021 did next u.s attorney there think trump's personal pick bobby christine did investigate any remaining claims fraud did find any evidence supported president's claims voter fraud pak understanding christine continued any investigations were pending time departure but was unable find any evidence fraud affected outcome election lofgren after investigating president's giuliani's claims about voter fraud georgia your view today there was evidence wide-spread fraud sufficient undermine confidence outcome election georgia pak correct lofgren thank pak want thank also for service have given our country appreciate next would like turn president trump's false allegations about election integrity philadelphia attorney general discussed these allegations some length attorney general barr know idea president has repeatedly suggested there was some kind outpouring unexpected votes inner city areas like philadelphia recently january 13th when walked off npr set was asked interviewer know what's--you know what's your evidence fraud said more people voted philadelphia than there were voters was absolute rubbish turnout philadelphia was line with state's turnout fact was not as--as impressive many suburban counties there was nothing strange about philadelphia turnout wasn't like there were all these unexpected votes came out philadelphia know think once actually look votes then there's obvious explanation he--you know for example pennsylvania trump ran weaker than republican ticket generally ran weaker than two state candidates ran weaker than congressional delegate--delegation running for federal congress ran weaker than the--the republican--i think haven't looked this recently but generally was weak element republican ticket does not suggest election was stolen fraud heaphy how about pennsylvania bill mcswain were talking with u.s attorney philadelphia about alleged discrepancy between number absentee ballots issued number ballots cast attorney general barr right i--i--you know was a--a one big ones for period time think--i think was raised gettysburg giuliani something like but kept being repeated found annoying because didn't seem was right called--i called mcswain got back said problem mastriano threw out a--threw out this number what did was mixed apples oranges took number applications for republican primary compared number absentee votes cast general election but once actually look compare apples apples there's discrepancy all know that's one the--i--i think some point covered with president lofgren have another witness here today who has detailed knowledge about election process philadelphia schmidt time presidential election were serving only republican member philadelphia's three-member city commission which responsible for overseeing elections throughout city correct schmidt correct congressperson lofgren president trump made numerous claims regarding fraudulent voting practices philadelphia including claim dead people were voting fact giuliani told pennsylvania state legislators 8,000 dead people voted pennsylvania investigated those claims voter fraud can tell what found schmidt not only was there not evidence 8,000 dead voters voting pennsylvania there wasn't evidence took seriously every case was referred matter how fantastical matter how absurd took every one those seriously including these lofgren turns out even trump's campaign lawyers knew dead voter claims weren't valid giuliani guess crooks philadelphia are disappointed this only submitted 8,021 ballots from dead people--mail-in ballots for dead people probably easier for dead people submit mail-in ballots than vote person herschmann rudy was this stage his life same ability manage things this level not obviously think bernie kerik publicly said never proved allegations were making were trying develop lofgren schmidt november president trump tweeted about saying--and here quote--``a guy named schmidt philadelphia commissioner so-called republican rino being used big time fake news media explain how honest things were with respect election philadelphia refuses look mountain corruption dishonesty result tweet cnn interview gave where stated dead voter claims pennsylvania were false your staff were subjected disturbing threats can tell about schmidt threats prior tweet--and some level feels almost silly talk about tweet but can really see impact have because prior threats were pretty general nature corrupt election officials philadelphia are gonna get what's coming them you're what second amendment for you're walking into lion's den''--all sorts things like after president tweeted name calling out way did threats became much more specific much more graphic included not just name but included members family name their ages our address pictures our home--just every bit detail could imagine was what changed with tweet lofgren behind are redacted threats received have provided committee now redacted portions text protect your family schmidt think speak for all colleagues when say are deeply sorry for what your loved ones have been through also want thank for your service your country for standing for rule law want thank both pak schmidt for their service their testimony for standing for rule law now would like turn another subject courts our country provide legitimate venue for campaigns challenge what view irregular election practices now courts have final say how law applies those challenges have renowned legal expert here address trump campaign's activities court ginsberg have spent your entire career representing republicans election-related litigation served national counsel republican presidential campaigns 2000 2004 2012 played key role 2000 florida recount led supreme court's decision bush gore served co-chair presidential commission election administration think fair say are most prominent republican lawyer who has litigated election field now have analyzed trump campaign's litigation pretty carefully what like normal process for post election litigation how was trump campaign's different from kinds post-election litigation have been involved know about ginsberg normal course things any campaign night election days after will couple different things one will analyze precinct results look for abnormalities results will send people those precincts ask more questions second all campaigns will have poll watchers poll workers observers polling place campaigns will talk those people saw any irregularities could cause problems election now trump campaign talked pre-election about having 50,000 poll workers presumably did have eyes ground all these places normal course things campaign will analyze reports come trump campaign had couple basic problems however election was not close 2000 was 537 close this election most narrow margin was 10,000-and-something arizona just don't make those sorts numbers recounts when claims fraud irregularities were made have heard very compelling testimony from stepien from matt morgan from alex cannon about those claims how didn't believe them put trump campaign sort-of process bringing cases without actual evidence have have which process designed bring out lofgren are aware any instance which court found trump campaign's fraud claims credible ginsberg there was never instance all cases were brought have looked more than include more than 180 counts simple fact trump campaign did not make its case lofgren select committee has identified post election lawsuits filed trump campaign his allies between november january 2021 those cases resulted losses only single victory which actually didn't affect outcome for either candidate despite those losses president trump his allies claim courts refused hear them out result never had their day court ginsberg what say about claims trump wasn't given opportunity provide evidence had voter fraud fact did have their day court ginsberg did have their day court about half those cases mentioned were dismissed procedural stage for lack standing--the proper people didn't bring case--or there wasn't sufficient evidence got dismissed motion dismiss but others there was discussion merits were contained complaints instance did court find charges fraud were real also worth noting even trump campaign complained did not have its day court there have been post-election reviews each battleground states could have made difference those ranged from somewhat-farcical cyber ninjas case arizona michigan senate report was mentioned earlier hand recount georgia pak addressed each one those instances there was credible evidence fraud produced trump campaign his supporters lofgren thank know ginsberg has explained there are cases where trump campaign was able convince court there was wide-spread fraud irregularities election over over judges appointed democrats republicans alike directly rebutted this false narrative called out trump campaign's lack evidence for its claims judges did even cases where could have simply thrown out lawsuit without writing word can see behind few excerpts from decisions these cases trump campaign's lack evidence was criticized judges across political spectrum pennsylvania trump-appointed judge concluded charges require specific allegations proof have neither here another trump-appointed judge warned cases like these succeeded any disappointed loser presidential election able hire team clever lawyers could flag claimed deviations from election results cast doubt election results list goes allegations are called amalgamation theories conjecture speculation another strained legal arguments without merit unsupported evidence derived from wholly unreliable sources fundamental obvious misreading constitution rejection president trump's litigation efforts was overwhelming twenty-two federal judges appointed republican presidents including appointed president trump himself least elected appointed republican state judges dismissed president's claims least lawyers have been referred for disciplinary proceedings due bad faith baseless efforts undermine outcome presidential election rudy giuliani had his license practice law suspended new york just this week newly-filed complaint will potentially make his suspension from practicing law d.c permanent have just heard from perhaps most preeminent republican election lawyer recent history trump campaign's unprecedented effort overturn its election court was deeply damaging abuse judicial process stated u.s district court judge david carter this was coup search legal theory thank chairman yield back chairman thompson want thank our witnesses for joining today members select committee may have additional questions for today's witnesses ask respond expeditiously writing those questions without objection members will permitted business days submit statements for record including opening remarks additional questions for witnesses second panel witnesses now dismissed without objection chair recognizes gentlewoman from california lofgren for closing statement lofgren thank chairman now understand litigation efforts president trump his allies would like present additional actions taken trump campaign during this time president trump continued push stolen election narrative even though his allies knew their litigation efforts making same claim had failed now worth pointing out litigation generally does not continue past safe harbor date december 14th but fact this litigation went on--well decision makes more sense when consider trump campaign's fundraising tactics because litigation had stopped december 14th there would have been fight defend election clear path continue raise millions dollars chairman this time would ask for unanimous consent include record video presentation describing how president trump used lies told raise millions dollars from american people these fundraising schemes were also part effort disseminate false claims election fraud chairman thompson without objection ordered wick name amanda wick i'm senior investigative counsel house select committee investigate january 6th attack united states capitol between election day january 6th trump campaign sent millions fundraising emails trump supporters sometimes many day emails claimed left-wing mob was undermining election implored supporters step protect integrity election encourage them fight back but select committee has demonstrated trump campaign knew these claims voter fraud were false yet continued barrage small-dollar donors with

here washington across media about how results these midterms defied history defied conventional wisdom remember back april may way democrats are going keep majority are going whole bunch seats people are asking what happened well think answer however rather simple this year democrats ran strong candidates compiled extremely strong legislative record which candidates could run republicans other hand ran with flawed candidates who spent more time talking about maga extremism than things truly mattered american people after failures--republican failures--in elections 2018 now 2022 hope message sinking republicans continue embrace maga radicalism are going keep losing for their own sake but more importantly for sake country hope very soon gop rejects maga wing makes commitment work with democrats next congress worst thing republicans can right now double down maga platform embrace gridlock but sadly seems path some other side still want take fact senator rick scott florida who notoriously led unsuccessful republican senate campaign efforts recently suggested one reasons republicans election day was because actually worked too much with democrats pass bipartisan legislation weren't maga enough defies all logic republicans want follow rick scott's lead make our day following senator scott like following blind man right over cliff remember was senator scott who released platform calling for tax hikes working middle americans which our candidates reminded people election over over again was senator scott who threatened put medicare social security chopping block which again was one most powerful arguments for why republicans were wrong for country was senator scott who embraced trump believed maga wing was road success denying elections spreading big lie encouraging maga extreme wing was right thing american people knew better american voters ran opposite direction voted for democrats including many republicans who said may reagan republican may bush republican but this republican party ain't one for after three failed elections--three row--it should obvious embracing maga total loser for republican party anyone thinks otherwise just look what happened last night purple arizona katie hobbs democratic nominee for governor was declared winner her race against kari lake everyone thought kari lake would because her communication skills but even lost--proof positive maga just doesn't work earnestly hope next couple months republicans will realize better for country--and even better for their party focus instead working with democrats over next years get things done for american people now know this not going happen overnight next week two our immediate focus course lameduck where there lot work done but when dust settles come january republicans have hopefully resolved some their own internal fights hope least some them will realize scorched-earth maga policy failure not only for america but for them usual pundits skeptics critics are saying this won't happen but look major bills did this summer five them major bills bipartisan before bif bill postal bill all done bipartisan--significant legislation democrats are going work hard replicate effort americans are tired chaos are tired maga insanity are tired maga attack very roots our democracy want leaders who will take their problems seriously most americans know donald trump out for himself only himself even hurts democracy even hurts republican party republicans should learn lesson risk even more failure future congressional record volume 168 number tuesday january

legislation have couple comments one given interest priority importance elections would have been helpful prior preparing this legislation for vote those were drafters this legislation actually invited republican--any republican--to sit down perhaps negotiate see could find some common ground but instead democrat leadership dusted off what had written before entirely partisan basis then are shocked--shocked republicans don't want support what drafted now note political overstatement hyperbole may relatively common are often excused but president some democratic colleagues have ventured deep into hysteria their cataclysmic predictions for failing support their entirely partisan election reform--worked out entirely themselves without any input whatsoever from any single person side aisle are far beyond pale now are entirely right call out donald trump's big lie about last election being stolen but same spirit honesty should not engage similar lie republicans across country are making much harder for minorities vote thus federal government must urgently displace centuries constitutional practice give states primary control over elections dire are consequences claim this must done shredding rules our senior legislative body point georgia evidence political election villainy president went there deliver his crowning argument but has been pointed out many before easier for minorities--and everybody else for matter--to vote georgia than president's home state delaware leader schumer's home state new york georgia there are more days early voting georgia there no-excuse

explain why don't support democrats bill first their bill weakens voter along with great majority voters all races favor voter photo their bill makes easier cheat accommodating unmonitored vote collection boxes their bill opens gates flood lawsuits pre post-election weakens safeguards voter registration there are other things democrats bill don't support not favor federal funding for campaigns also don't think states should required allow felons vote most fundamentally think reserving election procedures states founders made more difficult for would-be authoritarian change law for voting just one place--here washington--to keep himself office let add think democrats bill insufficiently focused real threat corruption counting ballots certification elections congressional provisions for accepting counting slate electors this where apparent conspirators were focused their attempt last election subvert democracy prevent peaceful transfer power now respect democrats who

order without objection chair authorized declare committee recess any point pursuant house deposition authority regulation chair announces committee's approval release deposition material presented during today's meeting good afternoon may god bless united states america four months ago this committee started present our findings american people from beginning understood some people watching those proceedings would wrongly assume committee's investigation was partisan exercise why asked those who were skeptical our work simply listen--to listen evidence hear testimony with open mind let facts speak for themselves before reaching any judgment over course these hearings evidence has proven there was multi-part plan led former president donald trump overturn election donald trump his bid for reelection shown from testimony some president's closest allies advisers donald trump knew despite this knowledge donald trump went court contest election court electoral college met declared joe biden winner yet donald trump continued pull out all stops his attempt stay power what donald trump proceeded after election something president has done before our country staggering betrayal his oath donald trump attempted plan led attack pillar our democracy still hard believe but facts testimony are clear consistent undisputed how know this how have been able present such clear picture what took place because testimony have heard have now presented through these proceedings because documentary evidence have gathered also made available directly american people when look back what has come out through this committee's work most striking fact all this evidence comes almost entirely from republicans evidence has emerged did not come from democrats opponents donald trump instead look who has written testified produced evidence who has been aides who have worked loyally for donald trump for years republican state officials legislators republican electors chairwoman republican national committee political professionals who worked highest levels trump campaign trump appointees who served most senior positions justice department president trump's staff closest advisers white house members president trump's family his own white house counsel have served congress long time can tell tough for any congressional investigation obtain evidence like what have received least all such detailed view into president's inner circle want clear not all these witnesses were thrilled talk some put quite fight but ultimately vast majority cooperated with our investigation what have shown over last months has been centered evidence--evidence has come overwhelmingly from republican witnesses say again did june this investigation not about politics not about party about facts plain simple about making sure our government functions under rule law our constitution demands today previous proceedings colleagues will present new evidence includes new testimony from additional republicans who served trump administration never-before-seen footage congressional leaders january 6th working coordinate response violence ensure people's business went forward new materials produced committee secret service details about ongoing threat american democracy today's proceeding will also grounded facts but won't look exactly like all our other hearings will also take step back look evidence broader context providing summary key facts have uncovered facts relevant former president trump's state mind about his motivation about his intent what did president trump know what was told what was his personal substantial role multi-part plan overturn election for those who have watched our prior hearings some this evidence will look familiar for those tuning for first time will summarize some most important facts urge on-line watch our hearing full there one more difference about today pursuant notice circulated prior today's proceedings are convened today not hearing but formal committee business meeting addition presenting evidence can potentially hold committee vote further investigative action based upon evidence before get evidence would recognize our distinguished vice chair cheney wyoming for any opening statement would care offer vice chair cheney thank very much chairman much has happened since our last public hearing july 21st chairman mentioned have received new voluminous documentation from secret service which continue analyze have received new witness testimony including about efforts obstruct our investigation conceal key facts according public reporting department justice has been very active pursuing many issues identified our prior hearings our committee may ultimately decide make series criminal referrals department justice but recognize our role not make decisions regarding prosecution preamble our constitution recites among its purposes establish justice our nation's judiciary our u.s department justice have responsibility key element this committee's responsibility propose reforms prevent january 6th from ever happening again have already proposed house has now passed bill amend electoral count act help ensure other future plots overturn election can succeed will make further specific recommendations our final report based part evidence will hear today our hearings last summer began with outline president trump's multi-part plan overturn presidential election then proceeded demonstrate each these elements detail with more than hours evidence today will see new evidence but chairman said will also synthesize evidence have seen before vast weight evidence presented far has shown central cause january 6th was one man donald trump who many others followed none this would have happened without him was personally substantially involved all exactly how did one man cause all this today will focus president trump's state mind his intent his motivations how spurred others his bidding how another january 6th could happen again not take necessary action prevent view our evidence today would suggest focus following points first will see president trump had premeditated plan declare election was fraudulent stolen before election day before knew election results made his stolen election claims election night against advice his campaign without any evidence hand then over next months sought find those who would help him invent spread lies about widespread fraud many those who stepped forward help including rudy giuliani knew never had real evidence sufficient change election results evening january 5th admitted were still trying find phantom evidence course result making intentionally false claims election fraud giuliani's license practice law has now been suspended second please recognize president donald trump was unique position better informed about absence widespread election fraud than almost any other american president trump's own campaign experts told him there was evidence support his claims his own justice department appointees investigated election fraud claims told him point-blank were false mid-december president trump's senior advisers told him time had come concede election donald trump knew courts had ruled against him had all this information but still made conscious choice claim fraudulently election was stolen pressure state officials change election results manufacture fake electoral slates attempt corrupt our department justice summon tens thousands supporters washington knowing were angry knowing some them were armed sent them capitol then riot was underway incited his supporters further violence publicly condemning his vice president then refused for hours disband his rioting supporters instruct them leave capitol even when was begged repeatedly none this normal acceptable lawful our republic third please consider today who had hand defeating president trump's efforts overturn election vice president pence bill barr jeff rosen others department justice state republican officials white house staff who blocked proposals mobilize military seize voting machines run new elections our capitol police aided metropolitan police other federal law enforcement our national guard who arrived later afternoon all these people had hand stopping donald trump this leads key question why would americans assume our constitution our institutions our republic are invulnerable another attack why would assume those institutions will not falter next time key lesson this investigation this our institutions only hold when men women good faith make them hold regardless political cost have guarantee these men women will place next time any future president inclined attempt what donald trump did has now learned not install people who could stand way also please consider this rulings our courts are respected obeyed because citizens pledge accept honor them most importantly our president who has constitutional obligation faithfully execute laws swears accept them what happens when president disregards courts rulings illegitimate when disregards rule law fellow citizens breaks our republic finally view evidence today also consider this president trump knew from unassailable sources his election fraud claims were false admitted had election took actions consistent with belief claims president trump actually thought election was stolen are not supported fact are not defense there defense donald trump was duped irrational president can defy rule law act this way constitutional republic period chairman our nation's federal judges are sworn impartial justice preserve our constitution preserve our union dozens these judges have been addressing january 6th cases many have given plain unmistakable warnings about direction our republic let read from one judge's statement given recent sentencing hearing high-ranking members congress state officials who know perfectly well claim fraud was untrue election was legitimate are afraid losing their power won't say has crystal clear not patriotism not standing for america stand for one man who knows full well instead constitution was trying subvert chairman violence lawlessness january 6th was unjustifiable but our nation cannot only punish foot soldiers who stormed our capitol those who planned overturn our election brought point violence must also accountable with every effort excuse justify conduct former president chip away foundation our republic indefensible conduct defended inexcusable conduct excused without accountability all becomes normal will recur watch evidence today please consider where our nation its history consider whether can survive for another 246 years most people most places earth have not been free america exception america continues only because bind ourselves our founders principles our constitution recognize some principles must beyond politics inviolate more important than any single american who has ever lived thank chairman yield back chairman thompson chair recognizes gentlewoman from california lofgren for opening statement lofgren thank chairman begin this meeting returning election night november chairman noted have previously presented testimony about how election results were expected come night certain states ballots cast mail before election day would counted only after polls closed evening meant election results would not known for some time although president trump's campaign manager bill stepien house republican leader kevin mccarthy jared kushner had advised donald trump encourage mail-in voting republicans president trump did not kushner yeah just remember generally know had people arguing had very very robust get-out-the-vote effort know mail-in ballots could good thing for looked correctly stepien there was one meeting was had particular invited kevin mccarthy join meeting being like mind issue with which made our case for why believed mail balloting--mail-in voting--not bad thing for his campaign but know president's mind was made lofgren was expected before election initial counts some states--in other words those votes cast election day--would more heavily republican this would create false perception lead for president trump so-called red mirage but results absentee ballots were later counted there could trends toward vice president biden those mail-in ballots were counted now election night donald trump's advisers specifically told him didn't have factual basis declare victory should wait for remaining ballots counted here campaign manager bill stepien stepien was far too early making any calls like ballots were still being counted ballots were still going counted for days was far too early making any proclamation like belief recommendation was say votes were still being counted too early tell too early call race lofgren but president trump did declare victory late hours election night not only did declare victory also called for ongoing count votes just stop stopping count would have violated both federal state laws also disenfranchised millions voters who lawfully cast their vote called for action anyway here what said president trump this fraud american public this embarrassment our country were getting ready this election frankly did this election did this election want all voting stop lofgren now know more about president trump's intentions for election night evidence shows his false victory speech was planned well advance before any votes had been counted was premeditated plan president declare victory matter what actual result was made plan stay office before election day now vice president's staff was concerned with what donald trump might election night took steps ensure pence would not echo false victory announcement from president trump here what vice president's counsel greg jacob told about his preparations with vice president's chief staff marc short jacob marc had indicated there was possibility there would declaration victory within white house some might push for--and this prior election results being known--and was trying figure out way avoiding vice president sort-of being thrust into position needing opine when might not have sufficient information lofgren now following this conversation jacob drafted memo short which select committee got from national archives memo was sent november 3rd election day advised essential vice president not perceived public having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior full development all relevant facts few days before election trump also consulted with one his outside advisers activist tom fitton about strategy for election night select committee got this pre-prepared statement from national archives can see draft statement which was sent october 31st declares had election today--and fitton memo specifically indicates plan only votes counted election day deadline''--and there election day deadline--would matter everyone knew ballot counting would lawfully continue past election day claiming counting election night must stop before millions votes were counted was now know key part president trump's premeditated plan election day just after p.m fitton indicated had spoken with president about statement sending along again just talked him about draft below again this plan declare victory was place before any results had been determined course our investigation also interviewed brad parscale president trump's former campaign manager told understood president trump planned early july would say election even just few days before election steve bannon former trump chief white house strategist outside adviser president trump spoke group his associates from china said this bannon what trump's gonna just declare victory right he's gonna declare victory but doesn't mean he's winner he's just going say he's winner democrats--more our people vote early count theirs vote mail they're going have natural disadvantage trump's going take advantage that's our strategy he's gonna declare himself winner when wake wednesday morning it's going firestorm also--also trump--if trump losing o'clock night it's going even crazier because he's going sit right there say stole i'm directing attorney general shut down all ballot places all states it's going be--no he's not going out easy trump--if biden's winning trump going some crazy shit lofgren know bannon refused testify our investigation has been convicted criminal contempt congress awaiting sentencing but evidence indicates bannon had advance knowledge trump's intent declare victory falsely election night but also bannon knew about trump's planning for january 6th here what bannon said january 5th bannon all hell going break loose tomorrow it's all converging now we're say point attack right point attack tomorrow i'll tell this it's not going happen like think it's going happen okay it's going quite extraordinarily different all can say strap have made this happen tomorrow it's game day strap let's get ready lofgren another close associate donald trump apparently knew trump's intentions well now roger stone political operative with reputation for dirty tricks november 2019 was convicted lying congress other crimes sentenced more than years prison also longtime adviser president trump was communication with president trump throughout trump pardoned roger stone december now recently select committee got footage stone before after election from danish filmmaker christoffer guldbrandsen pursuant subpoena right before election here roger stone talking about what president trump would after election stone let's just hope we're celebrating suspect it'll be--i really suspect will still air when happens key thing claim victory possession nine-tenths law fuck sorry over you're wrong fuck said fuck voting let's get right violence voice that's what fucking saying there point stone will have start smashing pumpkins know what mean voice yeah lofgren select committee called stone witness but invoked his fifth amendment right against self incrimination vice chair cheney believe violence january 6th was justified stone advice counsel respectfully decline answer your question basis fifth amendment vice chair cheney stone did have any role planning for violence january 6th stone once again will assert fifth amendment right decline answer your question lofgren although don't yet have all relevant records roger stone's communications even stone's own social media posts acknowledge spoke with donald trump december 27th preparations for january 6th were underway this post can see how roger stone talked about his conversations with president trump wrote also told president exactly how can appoint special counsel with full subpoena power ensure those who are attempting steal election through voter fraud are charged convicted ensure donald trump continues our president know now idea for special counsel was not just idle suggestion was something president trump had actually tried earlier month know roger stone was willard hotel january 5th 6th know from other witness testimony president trump asked his chief staff mark meadows speak with roger stone general michael flynn night addition his connection president trump roger stone maintained extensive direct connections two groups responsible for violently attacking capitol oath keepers proud boys individuals from both these organizations have been charged with crime seditious conspiracy now what seditious conspiracy conspiracy use violent force against united states oppose lawful authority united states multiple associates roger stone from both oath keepers proud boys have been charged with this crime close associates roger stone including joshua james have pled guilty this crime know least seven oath keepers--who have been criminally charged--provided personal security for roger stone were seen with him january 6th weeks leading january 6th for example joshua james leader alabama oath keepers provided security for roger stone was with him january 5th this picture two together january 5th james entered capitol january 6th assaulted police officer earlier this year pled guilty seditious conspiracy obstruction congress another example married couple kelly connie meggs now kelly meggs was leader florida chapter oath keepers both his wife provided security for roger stone both are charged with leading military-style stack attack oath keepers attacking capitol january 6th perhaps even more disturbing roger stone's close association with enrique tarrio national chairman proud boys roger stone's connection with enrique tarrio proud boys well-documented video evidence

tarrio sent message other proud boys claiming did also visited white house december 12th later day posted disturbing video claiming credit for attack this video posted january 6th was apparently created prior attack this big lie president trump's effort convince americans had election began before election results even came was intentional was premeditated was not based election results any evidence actual fraud affecting results any actual problems with voting machines was plan concocted advance convince his supporters people who seemingly knew about plan advance would ultimately play significant role events january 6th chairman yield back chairman thompson gentlewoman yields back chair recognizes gentleman from illinois kinzinger for opening statement kinzinger thank chairman very shortly after election trump campaign recognized had likely election informed donald trump fact even before networks called race for president biden november 7th his chances pulling out victory were virtually nonexistent president trump knew george know anybody ever told president had there wasn't chance him winning jason miller the--i know president when networks called--it--of course was informed about network--decision that--afternoon some point myself handful other folks went over sat down with president communicated odds prevailing legal challenges were very small lofgren know after election november 7th your judgment what were chances president trump winning election stirewalt after point lofgren yes stirewalt none kinzinger times president trump acknowledged reality his although publicly claimed had election privately admitted joe biden would take over president here are few examples general milley we're oval there's discussion going president says--i think it's--it could've been pompeo but says words effect yes need let issue next guy meaning president biden farah remember maybe week after election was called popped into oval just like give president headlines see how was doing was looking said can believe this f'ing guy hutchinson mark raised with 18th following conversation we're motorcade ride driving back white house had said like does president really think said know lot times he'll tell but wants keep fighting thinks there might enough overturn election but know pretty much has acknowledged he--that he's kinzinger knowing had had only weeks left office president trump rushed complete his unfinished business one key example this president trump issued order for large-scale u.s troop withdrawals disregarded concerns about consequences for fragile governments front lines fight against isis al-qaeda terrorists knowing was leaving office acted immediately signed this order november 11th which would have required immediate withdrawal troops from somalia afghanistan all complete before biden inauguration january 20th watch these clips recall general keith kellogg was national security advisor vice president had served chief staff national security council for president trump general milley was chairman joint chiefs staff pentagon wood are familiar with memo president reportedly signed november ordering troops withdrawn from afghanistan somalia kellogg yes general milley think might have seen some things where there's memo something from johnny mcentee douglas macgregor says here's your task get u.s forces out of--out somalia get u.s forces out afghanistan dayananda when first interviewed met colonel douglas macgregor fair say discussed this decision withdrawing from somalia afghanistan correct mcentee yes i'm sure was part yes dayananda was--the position was taking over there was senior adviser secretary defense correct mcentee yes dayananda same day just i'm clear responded back meaning dod leadership was not going take any those steps without order mcentee without directive yes macgregor explained language should order while was meeting with mcentee this was answer him said want this happen president wants this happen he's got write order marx never wrote this down any capacity macgregor well sketched piece paper for him some key statements know president directs know this is--what's right word boilerplate language dayananda who was his office drafted order mcentee was myself one assistants general milley mcentee duly types brings president president signs boom it's over--faxed over emailed scanned over--and kash patel delivers dayananda was autopen was president himself signing mcentee was president dayananda who obtained signature mcentee did general milley odd not standard potentially dangerous personally thought was militarily not feasible nor wise kellogg proceeded tell ppo proceeded tell macgregor ever saw anything like would something physical because thought what was done was tremendous disservice nation way was--that--it was very contested issue there were people who did not agree with getting out afghanistan appreciate their concerns immediate departure memo said would have been catastrophic it's same thing what president biden went through would have been debacle kinzinger keep mind order was for immediate withdrawal would have been catastrophic yet president trump signed order these are highly consequential actions president who knows his term will shortly end same time president trump was acknowledging privately had election was hearing there was evidence fraud irregularities sufficient change outcome cannon remember call with meadows where meadows was asking what was finding was finding anything remember sharing with him weren't finding anything would sufficient change results any key states harris when was conversation cannon probably november mid-to-late november think was before child was born harris what was meadows's reaction information cannon believe words used were there's there there stepien would our job track down come dry because allegation didn't prove true we'd have relay news yes someone told about those votes fraud nothing came would our job truth-telling squad it's not fun job much--it's easier job telling president about wild allegations it's harder job telling him back end yes that's--that wasn't true morgan what was generally discussed topic was whether fraud maladministration abuse irregularities aggregated read most favorably campaign would outcome determinative think everyone's assessment room least amongst staff marc short myself greg jacob was was not sufficient outcome-determinative kinzinger look right any candidate litigate genuine election disputes nobody argues but president trump's litigation was completely unsuccessful our past hearings told committee had identified total election lawsuits filed trump campaign its allies between november 4th january 6th 2021 those cases resulted losses only single victory which did not affect outcome for any candidate claims were not supported any sufficient evidence fraud irregularities fact were baseless judges repeatedly recognized none these cases was president trump able establish any viable claims election fraud sufficient overturn results election those hearings shared with words used judges around country rejecting trump campaign's claims strong language criticizing lack evidentiary support for claims election fraud those lawsuits for example federal appeals court pennsylvania wrote charges require specific allegations proof have neither here federal judge wisconsin wrote court has allowed former president chance make his case has merits another judge michigan called claims nothing but speculation conjecture votes for president trump were either destroyed discarded switched votes for vice president biden federal judge michigan sanctioned nine attorneys including sidney powell for making frivolous allegations election fraud case describing case historic profound abuse judicial process recently group distinguished republican election lawyers former judges elected officials issued report confirming findings courts their report entitled not stolen these prominent republicans analyzed each election challenge concluded this donald trump his supporters failed present evidence fraud inaccurate results significant enough invalidate results presidential election december 11th trump's allies lawsuit u.s supreme court regarded his last chance success courts newly obtained secret service message from day shows how angry president trump was about outcome just fyi potus pissed--breaking news--supreme court denied his lawsuit livid now cassidy hutchinson aide chief staff mark meadows was present for conversation described this way hutchinson this day supreme court had rejected case meadows were white house residence christmas reception were walking back from christmas reception evening president was walking out oval office crossed paths rose garden colonnade president was fired about supreme court decision know was standing next meadows meadows but stepped back was probably feet catty-corner from diagonal from him know president just raging about decision how it's wrong why didn't make more calls know just his typical anger outburst this decision president said had--i had put quote--okay had said something effect don't want people know mark this embarrassing figure out need figure out don't want people know kinzinger our country country laws where every person including president must follow law respect judgment our courts president trump's closest advisers held view both then now vice chair cheney well believe president should abide rulings courts secretary state pompeo yes should all comply with law all times best our ability every one vice chair cheney once courts had ruled electoral college had met election was over your view secretary state pompeo yes think i--i think i've said previously when vice president made certification litigation was complete was complete vice chair cheney when electoral college met 14th secretary state pompeo yes december 14th right think that's right date yes vice chair cheney assume pat would agree president obligated abide rulings courts cipollone course vice chair cheney assume also would cipollone everybody obligated abide rulings courts vice chair cheney assume also would agree president has particular obligation take care laws faithfully executed cipollone one president's obligations correct vice chair cheney ivanka believe president's obligated abide rulings courts trump kinzinger mid-december president trump's senior staff were attempting persuade him concede election outcome cipollone but your question did believe should concede election point time yes did attorney general barr december 14th was day states certified their votes sent them congress view was end matter didn't see--you know thought this would lead inexorably new administration deere told him personal viewpoint was electoral college had met which system our country set under elect president vice president believed point means for him pursue litigation was probably closed wood recall what his response any was deere disagreed kinzinger secretary labor gene scalia son late justice scalia visited president trump mid-december explained situation clearly secretary labor scalia had put call president--i might have called 13th spoke believe 14th--in which conveyed him thought was time for him acknowledge president biden had prevailed election but communicated president when legal process exhausted when electors have voted that's point which outcome needs expected told him did believe yes once those legal processes were run fraud had not been established had affected outcome election then unfortunately believed what had done was concede outcome kinzinger not only did courts reject president trump's fraud other allegations his department justice appointees including bill barr jeffrey rosen richard donoghue did well president trump knew truth heard what all his experts senior staff were telling him knew had election but made deliberate choice ignore courts ignore justice department ignore his campaign leadership ignore senior advisers pursue completely unlawful effort overturn election his intent was plain ignore rule law stay power chairman yield back chairman thompson gentleman yields back chair recognizes gentlewoman from virginia mrs luria mrs luria thank chairman mid-december was turning point president trump made decision choice ignore courts his advisers push forward overturn election his efforts overturn election were not random disconnected rather were part coordinated multi part plan ensure stayed power donald trump was driver behind each part this plan was personally directly involved course key element plan was continuing convince tens millions americans did not fact again did this even though his own campaign advisers his justice department officials told him his claims fraud were wrong this video will see even when top law enforcement officials told president his election fraud claims were false still repeated claims days weeks followed sometimes even very next day attorney general barr specifically raised dominion voting machines which found among most disturbing allegations disturbing sense saw absolutely zero basis for allegations told him was crazy stuff were wasting their time was doing grave disservice country president trump have company that's very suspect its name dominion with turn dial change chip can press button for trump vote goes biden what kind system this donoghue definitely talked about antrim county again was sort-of done point because hand recount had been done all but cited back say know this example what people are telling what's being filed some these court filings are just not supported evidence this problem problem people keep telling these things turn out not true president trump addition there highly troubling matter dominion voting systems one michigan county alone 6,000 votes were switched from trump biden same systems are used majority states our country attorney general barr went into this would know tell him how crazy some these allegations were how ridiculous some them were i'm talking about some things like know more votes--more absentee votes were cast pennsylvania than there were absentee ballots requested know stuff like was just easy blow there was never--there was never indication interest what actual facts were president trump there were more votes than there were voters think had more votes than had voters that's easy one figure it's thousands attorney general barr then raised big vote dump called detroit said people saw boxes coming into counting station all hours morning said president there are 630 precincts detroit unlike elsewhere state centralize counting process they're not counted each precinct they're moved counting stations normal process would involve boxes coming all different hours president trump this michigan 6:31 morning vote dump 149,772 votes came unexpectedly donoghue with regard georgia looked tape interviewed witnesses there suitcase president kept fixating this suitcase supposedly had fraudulent ballots suitcase was rolled out from under table said sir there suitcase can watch video over over there suitcase there wheeled bin where carry ballots that's just how move ballots around facility there's nothing suspicious about all president trump election officials pull boxes democrats suitcases ballots out from under table all saw television totally fraudulent mrs luria this happened over over again our committee's report will document purposeful lies made public directly odds with what donald trump knew from unassailable sources justice department's own investigations his own campaign donald trump maliciously repeated this nonsense wide audience over over again his intent was deceive president trump's plan also involved trying coerce government officials change election outcome states personally reached out numerous state officials pressured them take unlawful steps alter election results those states these actions taken directly president himself made clear what his intentions were prevent orderly transfer power all recall for example president trump's tape-recorded call with georgia secretary state brad raffensperger time this call occurred president trump had already been told repeatedly u.s justice department his campaign his advisers his allegations fraud georgia were false president trump look all want this just want find 11,780 votes which one more than have because state look need only 11,000 votes have far more than stands now we'll have more more what are going here folks only need 11,000 votes fellas need 11,000 votes give break mrs luria just want find 11,780 votes extraordinary demand president especially since already knew from justice department there was genuine basis for this request one could think would legal for secretary state simply find votes president needed order secretary raffensperger told president truth--that election georgia but president trump did not accept answer instead suggested secretary raffensperger himself might prosecuted president trump that's a--you know that's criminal--that's criminal offense know can't let happen that's big risk ryan your lawyer that's big risk mrs luria know president trump's white house advisors reacted negatively immediately after call cassidy hutchinson had conversation with chief staff mark meadows hutchinson remember looking mark said mark can't possibly think we're going pull this off like call was crazy looked just started shaking his head he's like cass know knows it's over knows but we're going keep trying there are some good options out there still we're going keep trying mrs luria this call other related activity now focus ongoing criminal investigation fulton county georgia georgia not only state where president trump tried pressure state officials change results also attempted pressure state officials arizona pennsylvania michigan change results those states well while president trump was pressuring state officials was also trying use department justice change election result his top officials told him there was evidence support his claims fraud but didn't care told them just say election was corrupt leave rest republican congressmen when these officials would not what said president trump embarked effort install jeff clark acting attorney general solely because would what others department would not know trump was doing for specific purpose clark could corruptly employ justice department's authority help persuade states flip electoral votes for example when richard donoghue jeff rosen both appointed president trump learned clark's proposal here why said forcefully rejected donoghue recall toward end saying what you're proposing nothing less than united states justice department meddling outcome presidential election but more importantly this was not based fact this was actually contrary facts developed department investigations over last several weeks months responded for department insert itself into political process this way think would have had grave consequences for country may very well have spiraled into constitutional crisis mrs luria know from our investigation president trump offered jeff clark position acting attorney general jeff clark had decided accept only reason this ultimately did not happen white house counsel number justice department officials confronted president oval office threatened mass resignations donoghue then--and said something effect you're going have huge personnel blowout within hours because you're going have all kinds problems with resignations other issues that's not going anyone's interest mrs luria president ultimately relented only because entire leadership department justice well his white house counsel threatened resign chairman yield back chairman thompson gentlewoman yields back chair recognizes gentlewoman from florida mrs murphy for opening statement mrs murphy thank chairman president trump's efforts unlawfully overturn results election were not limited big lie pressuring state officials department justice officials another key part president's effort was scheme assemble fake electors cast false electoral votes states president trump this was something done not only with president's knowledge but also with his direct participation ronna mcdaniel chair republican national committee testified before this committee president trump his attorney john eastman called her asked her arrange for fake electors meet rehearse process casting their fake votes mcdaniel when received call--again don't remember exact date--it was from white house switchboard was president trump who had contacted wood did president trump have anyone else line with him mcdaniel introduced gentleman named john eastman vaguely remember him mentioning was professor then essentially turned call over eastman who then proceeded talk about importance rnc helping campaign gather these contingent electors case any legal challenges were ongoing changed result any states mrs murphy these fake electors were ultimately part president's plan replace genuine biden electors with trump electors january 6th part this plan false electoral slates were sent national archives capitol fake electors plan was also tied another plan coercive pressure campaign make vice president mike pence reject refuse count certain biden electoral votes president donald trump would reelection instead here what vice president pence has said about this scheme vice president pence president trump said had right overturn election but president trump wrong had right overturn election presidency belongs american people american people alone frankly there idea more american than notion any one person could choose american president mrs murphy make mistake president trump knew what was demanding vice president pence was illegal was informed this repeatedly specifically january 4th even his lawyer john eastman admitted front president trump this plan would break law violating electoral count act wood did john eastman ever admit far know front president his proposal would violate electoral count act jacob believe did 4th mrs murphy eastman confirmed this writing recall this email written january 6th which vice president pence's counsel asked eastman did advise president your professional judgment vice president does not have power decide things unilaterally eastman replied he's been advised course president trump's own white house counsel pat cipollone also recognized this plan was unlawful here cipollone's testimony cipollone view vice president didn't have legal authority anything except what did mrs murphy there doubt president trump's pressure campaign vice president pence was significant morning january 6th president trump called vice president from oval office demanded overturn results election numerous witnesses told select committee about invective president trump leveled his own vice president luna something effect--this is--the wording's wrong made wrong decision years ago tonolli word relayed president called vice president--i apologize for being impolite but remember what said her father called him radford word mrs murphy but vice president pence didn't waver even when his own life was endangered president trump rioters capitol january 6th you'll see more detail later federal judge concluded based this other evidence president trump's pressure campaign against vice president likely violated multiple criminal statutes end all these people--department justice officials state elections officials his own vice president stood strong face president trump's immense pressure but now know president trump had already summoned tens thousands his supporters washington january 6th take back their country december 19th president trump first

jimmy carter former secretary state jim baker who had previously served chief staff for president reagan this editorial wrote stand opposite sides partisan divide but believe better search for solutions together than remain divided this particularly true vexing problem could wreak havoc during 2024 presidential election inadequacy electoral count act 1887 act antiquated muddled potentially unconstitutional law allows uncertainty during critical step peaceful transfer power weaknesses law started become apparent after 2000 election editorial continues 2021 ambiguities law helped lead violent assault u.s capitol efforts were being made toss out several states slates electoral votes fortunately those efforts failed rightful winners took office but threat confusion remains left unclosed loopholes act could allow repeat same destructive path occurred 2021 washington post has written several editorials this subject well june 2022 editorial post entitled fix electoral count law

working group consider possible eca reforms particular want thank cochairs bob bauer jack goldsmith for their contributions our efforts also want thank staff protect democracy for their suggestions work here our legislation aims ensure congress can accurately correctly tally electoral votes cast states which should consistent with each state's popular vote for president vice president united states our legislation clarifies some ambiguities terms appropriate state federal roles selecting next president vice president united states set forth u.s constitution our constitutional system election law like many other areas law involves shared powers between federal government one hand state local governments other article section constitution provides times places manner holding elections for senators representatives shall prescribed each state legislature thereof clause constitution continues concluding but congress may any time law make alter such regulations have power here what electoral count act about article section constitution provides each state shall appoint such manner legislature thereof may direct number electors equal whole number senators representatives which state may entitled congress constitution also provides congress may determine time choosing electors day which shall give their votes which day shall same throughout united states 12th amendment constitution ratified 1804 sets out framework for congress tally count electoral votes from states congress later passed electoral count act eca 1887 aftermath contested hayes-tilden presidential election 1876 which states sent competing slates electors congress our legislation takes several key steps modernize eca reduce opportunity for constitutional mischief when comes congress properly counting electoral votes states first legislation helps make easier for congress identify single conclusive slate electors from each state legislation requires each state's governor responsible for submitting certificate ascertainment identifying state's electors state may designate another individual besides governor carry out this function such secretary state such individual named before election day itself again state executive official reporting their electoral votes congress must such under pursuance laws such state providing for such ascertainment enacted prior election day our legislation therefore seeks avoid circumstances which state attempts change rules after election day due political pressure may arise particular favored candidate loses election congress could not accept slate electors from official not authorized state law enacted prior election day our legislation provides states following these rules will have their appointments electors treated conclusive congress subject any subsequent state federal judicial relief granted prior date meeting electors our legislation states determination federal courts shall conclusive questions arising under constitution laws united states second legislation modernizes failed election language eca specify state could modify its period voting election day only necessitated extraordinary page s3601 catastrophic events provided under laws state enacted prior election day this provision makes clear state legislature tries override popular vote their state would not allowed third legislation provides for expedited judicial review certain claims relating state's certificate identifying its electors have limited this special judicial review our legislation only available aggrieved presidential candidates this special procedure allows for challenges made under federal law u.s constitution resolved more efficiently using special three-judge panel with direct timely appeal u.s supreme court fourth legislation makes clear vice president has purely ministerial role joint session congress count states electoral votes particular our legislation states vice president does not have power solely determine accept reject otherwise adjudicate disputes over electors specifically includes objections over proper list electors validity electors votes electors president trump pressured vice president use this illegal method order overturn election results ultimately this effort was rejected vice president pence his capacity president senate presided over january 2021 joint session fifth our legislation increases threshold needed lodge objection electors from one senator one representative one fifth duly chosen sworn members both house senate similarly article section constitution provides yeas nays members either house any question shall desire one fifth those present entered journal this will reduce risk likelihood frivolous objections being lodged which requires lengthy debate vote separate houses house has vote separately senate has vote separately takes lot time for example january 2021 senate voted reject vote objection against electors arizona voted objections raised electors from pennsylvania sixth our legislation clarifies electors are not lawfully appointed objection sustained congress rejecting electors not lawfully appointed those electors would not included denominator for determining majority whole number electors appointed means can reach decision day count votes main focus our work over past months has been this sorely needed reform eca but our working group came with number bipartisan reforms some other matters related elections presidential transition improvement act would help promote orderly transfer power between presidential administrations saw failure timely ascertainment winner administrator u.s general services administration uncooperative attitude trump administration led delay providing transition resources incoming biden administration this legislation provides clearer guidelines for eligible candidates for president vice president receive federal resources support their transitions including allowing more than one candidate receive these resources during time period when outcome election reasonable doubt postal service election improvement act seeks improve handling mail-in ballots u.s postal service provides guidance best practices states improve their mail-in ballot processes state law allows election assistance commission reauthorization act would reauthorize election assistance commission for years eac administers grants states develops nonbinding guidance best practices for election officials various areas including cyber security election audits voting accessibility what this legislation does not include any substantive provision strengthen voting rights this country which desperately needed sorely disappointed omission our nation has long history bipartisan work voting rights issues repeatedly raised voting rights issues with our larger group well with our smaller subgroup voting practices let take moment remind colleagues our voting rights history voting rights act 1965 was approved broad bipartisan vote 328 house vote senate congress had long bipartisan track record clarifying its intent response restrictive supreme court decisions--that until recently 1982 congress amended section voting rights act after mobile bolden decision which supreme court interpreted section prohibiting only purposeful discrimination was very restrictive making voting rights act much less effective congress responded decision clarifying section explicitly bans any voting practice had discriminatory result irrespective whether practice was enacted operated for discriminatory purpose 1982 amendments--these are amendments corrected supreme court's restricted decision--passed house vote 389 senate vote were signed into law president reagan bipartisan action over years later congress acted address two supreme court rulings clarify congressional intent regarding section voting rights act this reauthorization passed 390 house senate was signed into law president george bush--again bipartisan action after supreme court's decision shelby county holder 2013 after brnovich 2021 congress should have acted clarify intent voting rights act but didn't now are faced today with totally unnecessary partisan gridlock voting rights saw this gridlock play out this january when senate refused even take debate freedom vote john lewis act let mention one section vra particular section voting rights act protects against discriminatory voting laws prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing voting qualification prerequisite voting standard practice procedure manner which results denial abridgement right vote account race color language minority status for nearly years case law has interpreted section combat racial discrimination without partisan favor prior brnovich case supreme court several circuit courts had adopted standard ensure effective implementation these provisions consistent with text purpose act amended 1982 brnovich decision deviated from congressional intent behind section court adopted unduly narrow reading section went beyond statutory interpretation courts for decades outlining five new guideposts decision not tethered statutory text inconsistent with statute's purpose historical usage wasn't first time court narrowed our law but previous efforts came together democrats republicans make sure voting rights act was effective disappointed could not make progress our working group address needed fix section should have also looked issue right private action since voting rights act's enactment 1965 congress has intended voters able sue directly enforce voting rights act rather than depend entirely upon u.s department justice which has finite resources protect voting rights want thank colleague senator murkowski for consistently raising this issue voting rights act's private right action settled law congress has repeatedly noted its voting rights act's amendments even though private right action clear settled law our group should have removed any ambiguity about its intent proposing language making more explicit statute's existing right for private action just page s3602 resolved ambiguities eca its potential misinterpretation should have done same with this critical right private action under voting rights act--a missed opportunity recent report from brennan center points out state legislatures have been working make harder vote after elections even after witnessing record turnout during pandemic brennan center wrote 2022 s]tate lawmakers who spent 2021 passing laws made harder vote have focused more intently election interference passing nine laws could lead tampering with how elections are run how results are determined election interference laws two primary things open door partisan interference elections threaten people processes make elections work many cases these efforts are being justified measures combat baseless claims widespread voter fraud stolen election brennan center noted many these same state legislatures lawmakers have continued introduce enact laws restrict access vote legislation categorized restrictive would make harder for eligible americans register stay rolls and/or vote compared existing state law free fair elections are fundamental who are nation for this reason strongly support bipartisan working group's proposal reform modernize eca saw elections different interpretations electoral count act can lead down dangerous path another january 6-style insurrection when former president donald trump his enablers attempted overturn free

read follows bill s.3436 require imposition sanctions with respect entities responsible for planning construction operation nord stream pipeline their corporate officers apply congressional review under countering america's adversaries through sanctions act removal sanctions relating nord stream for other purposes presiding officer senator from new hampshire 3436 mrs shaheen madam president come floor today speak opposition 3436 which nord stream 2's sanctions bill sponsored senator cruz certainly share concerns have been expressed just few minutes ago senator mcconnell about threat russia poses ukraine eastern europe role nord stream plays critical issue have been strong longstanding opponent nord stream believe now what believed time originally cosponsored nord stream sanctions bill with senator cruz nord stream pipeline long-term threat energy security europe but right now are different place this while senator cruz worked together sanctions legislation stop this pipeline disagreement now with senator cruz his approach what need address what right now much more serious threat europe nato transatlantic alliance russia's threat against ukraine what senator cruz's bill would not stop nord stream would undermine current diplomatic situation absolutely critical are going respond russian threat his bill vote--supporting his bill would vote compromise transatlantic community vote breaks message bipartisan support face russian aggression furthermore not just bipartisan support but allied support with united states germany western europe against threat russia poses ukraine really eastern germany take this action dynamics nord stream have changed since senator cruz fought for passage legislation prevent completion pipeline time worked together provide trump administration with critical tools sanction this pipeline did because there were some members trump administration who came said need this legislation because administration has not acted fact percent construction nord stream pipeline was completed during trump years unfortunately trump administration even after passed sanctions legislation sat those sanctions waited until literally last day trump administration sanction just one entity just one entity years what saw what just said percent pipeline was completed during trump years now are very different situation right now unfortunately because are situation where russia threatening ukraine need work closely with our european allies present united front against russia have strengthened our relationship with our german allies biden administration has restored diplomacy-first foreign policy which seeks page s199 advance american policy interests through dialogue not through threats there new german coalition government place are now engaging with government appears more skeptical about nord stream pipeline have paused certification pipeline stalled its operation until least later this year new government has indicated this pipeline not just economic project very clear dynamics have changed when dynamics change ground then our approach our foreign policy should reflect those changes can't look this legislation isolation this legislation senator cruz proposing are going voting today coming time when administration exhausting every single diplomatic avenue deter putin from further violating ukraine's territorial integrity russia has amassed over 100,000 troops ukraine's border course next month really going critical changing putin's calculation any invasion would come with hefty price nord stream right now presents potential incentive for putin use against our european partners but also leverage leverage west can use pivotal moment russia thinking about--vladimir putin thinking about what going ukraine believe need stop this pipeline long term there may time future when another change our approach pipeline may necessary know happens with foreign policy don't live static world dynamic demands adopt our responses have joined senator menendez democrats introducing defending ukraine sovereignty act 2022 legislation does reflect reality ground would impose swift crippling sanctions russia's economy putin decides invade would provide critical additional military support our ukrainian allies would strengthen support our eastern european allies face putin's attempt look backward not forward are not going give vladimir putin russia ability veto who joins nato saw very clearly session yesterday with russian nato officials russia didn't like because didn't get answer wanted which was veto over who should able join nato are going continue take strong stand with our allies opposition what russia doing but can't use yesterday's solutions help solve today's problems immediate threat are facing right now threat russian invasion ukraine need everything possible work closely possible show daylight with our allies standing threat unfortunately what senator cruz proposing with nord stream sanctions legislation would exactly would drive wedge between our allies particularly between united states germany time cannot afford intend vote against this legislation support senator menendez's legislation will give tools need continue address potential russian aggression yield floor look forward hearing senator murphy's comments because know shares same concerns expressing presiding officer senator from connecticut murphy madam president first foremost let thank senator shaheen has been leader senate our caucus raising alarms about danger nord stream european security ukrainian security have been glad work with her over these past several years here floor join her our strong opposition legislation pending floor speak this bill passes won't make nord stream pipeline any less likely won't stop russia from invading ukraine fact will exact opposite will make completion nord stream more likely will gift russia dividing from our european allies right moment when need solidarity with them order deter russian aggression will try not repeat too much what senator shaheen has said but let just underscore points has made first sanctions this bill are unfortunately pretty feckless are feckless because can undone easily within days russian government reality don't convince our european partners stop moving forward with this project there amount u.s sanction can effective here what know even were sanction this german-swiss company german board directors matter days weeks maybe few months russians could reengineer financing administration project keep going even more interesting what senator mcconnell just said senator mcconnell just came floor said while supports senator cruz's proposal expects biden administration will waive sanctions then why are engaging this first place republicans are going support waiving sanctions because sanctions would interrupt our negotiations with germany why pass bill first place apparently many republicans are supporting cruz bill but then are going asking biden administration not implement doesn't seem make lot sense primary impact this bill senator shaheen explained divide from germany why because know only way stop nord stream convincing germans other europeans stop project now have for first time since began talking germans about this convinced them press pause--the first time german government has decided press pause through their regulatory agencies have stopped certification pipeline which way built was percent built when president trump left office let constructed--95 percent built now 100 percent built but germans have because american diplomacy because threat invasion ukraine from russia pressed pause this project can't start until summer fall frankly time allows continue engage with germans others try convince them this project not their interest think about this from german perspective finally said yes united states minute say yes minute u.s senate decides sanction german citizens bad diplomacy just bad diplomacy moment which have lockstep with our european partners need sending message vladimir putin united states europe are together are going deliver crushing package sanctions enter ukraine any further this would gift vladimir putin because signal division moment when need standing together senator menendez has right approach senator menendez has proposed bill which think can draw support from percent this body enacts set sanctions russia russia moves any farther into ukraine beyond where are already eastern ukraine crimea sends right signal effective message consequence rather than this proposal which apparently set sanctions republicans are going ask waived divides from our partners moment when need together lastly want address one particular point have heard senator cruz make over over over again defense his proposal senator cruz says construction pipeline stopped when congress passed nord stream sanctions didn't begin again until joe biden became president have seen repeated press just isn't true page s200 one company was laying pipeline backed out project when 2019 sanctions bill was passed but then guess what happened russia started retrofitting other ships finish job minute were permitted construction began again--not when joe biden was president when donald trump was president ships were ready may before joe biden was even nominated started work few months later soon danish government permitted them now senator shaheen senator cruz had passed sanctions bill with all our support end 2019 during all while russians were retrofitting these ships while were sending them back danish waters while permitting process was happening donald trump didn't enact one sanction was permitted congress congress passed law end 2019 all donald trump didn't enact single sanction this was critical moment this was time which meat pipeline was being built president trump did nothing paid consequence for know why because senator cruz didn't hold any donald trump's state department nominees when trump was refusing implement sanctions when russians sent ships started showing restart construction not even when construction restarted fall 2020--nope during this time all trump's state department nominees sailed through without single republican objection blockade trump's last day office his last day literally was packing oval office january sanctioned one ship company owned ship--essentially signal how little cared day was leaving sanctioned one ship company owned ship but this time percent pipeline was complete was too late then begrudgingly hands over keys oval office joe biden leaves incoming president with mess--a pipeline percent built donald trump could have stopped had used sanctions was given can understand why some wonder what motivation behind senator cruz's extraordinary tactics now when pipeline already built seems difference between 2021 essentially now there democrat white house this bill isn't going help ukraine designed hurt president united states unfortunately some--not all--not all but some our republican colleagues here have consistently put their desire politically harm president biden ahead their desire protect nation holding confirmation president biden's nominees doesn't help security nation just increases chances united states won't have personnel hand deal with crisis somewhere around world when develops failure may hurt joe biden's approval rating unfortunately think what going here unfortunately think what going here hope colleagues see yield floor presiding officer booker senator from new hampshire mrs shaheen would colleague yield for question murphy would mrs shaheen senator murphy really pleased--sadly pleased but think really appropriate brought issue about holding state department nominees because one things have been unfortunate about senator cruz's approach nord stream recent weeks has not just been his holding nominees but has been his suggestion change response part others who oppose nord stream has been partisan but point out during all trump administration senator cruz did not hold one nominee because nord stream your understanding murphy understanding understanding there may have been private advocacy public speeches given but there certainly wasn't tactic used had been used during which extraordinary holding all nominees think would add democratic senators have not used tactic had huge disagreements with president trump's policy including his failure use sanctions were given him congress stop pipeline moment when those sanctions would have been most effective but didn't block all president trump's ambassadors state department personnel because thought was better have those people hand working protect u.s interests than was have those positions vacant case have been trying make this floor really care about helping ukraine why did senator cruz spend all blocking ambassadors state department personnel whose job would have been help ukraine one has been more engaged this question this fight than have senator shaheen mrs shaheen well think other important point both made fact what stopped policies pipeline when first sanctions bill was passed was threat sanctions wasn't actually implementing those sanctions fact was then russia's ability come back retrofit ships work themselves gazprom russia russian ships did work themselves throughout last year trump administration refused take any action address fact remember being meeting--i can't remember were meeting not--with senator cruz some our republican colleagues member administration urging pass another sanctions bill because administration had not acted think really important say point out percent pipeline was done under previous administration when senator cruz our colleagues who would like stop pipeline had opportunity hold his nominees raise those concerns did not happen puts disadvantage today look threat nord stream would agree with murphy would don't mind senator shaheen will just through timeline once again because think important december 2019 congress passed sanctions bill senator cruz championed stops allseas private company from constructing pipeline pull back but immediately russia starts retrofitting their own ships knew saw this wasn't secret happens from beginning may those ships are their way from may until october are caught permitting but just matter time everybody knows those ships are eventually going start laying down pipe october before joe biden elected president those ships are back doing construction october november december all throughout end those ships are back rebuilding pipeline such january last day trump's presidency percent pipeline--somewhere around percent pipeline--is done then literally walking out door donald trump lays down sanction one company one ship company owns all through there was blockade state department nominees grinding halt senate nominations business try prompt president change his mind all magically starts happening when joe biden president when percent pipeline done hope senator shaheen--and will let wrap up--i hope can find way get same page here because have been for much last several years have led effort think senator menendez's legislation which all about right set incentives disincentives for russian behavior perhaps means can sort elevate this above question who president get back fighting for interests our nation interests our partners ukraine page s201 mrs shaheen thank senator murphy couldn't have said anything better yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded call roll thune president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered thune president just quick observation two about what colleagues from new hampshire connecticut were just speaking issue nord stream pipeline intend talk about another subject but was listening their dialogue subject there were couple things thought were important respond had indicated there bill offered senator menendez their side aisle thought would get 90-plus votes here u.s senate would say colleagues democratic side senator cruz was advocating for vote his amendment offered offered vote menendez vote his amendment menendez was turned down democrat leadership was put forward offer senator from texas senator cruz just also make point--this isn't something new issue for him has been advocating nord stream pipeline for years fact there were sanctions put place under previous administration which think had been quite effective with respect holding state department nominees sometimes around here have get people's attention order get vote something mean didn't have hold nominees last administration because allowed for vote this administration has not been case has been trying for literally weeks months happened here wee hours morning few weeks ago friday evening when this was being discussed were waiting for some agreement between him democrat leadership about giving him vote this amendment ultimately when got vote his amendment turned loose 40-some state department nominees think has this case played fairly played rules senate exercised leverage has u.s senator ensure got vote issue critically important not only him would say this entire body but our country certainly our allies region there one final point will make everybody were talking about this was saying wow know this is--all sudden this issue has become relevant one well has always been relevant one defending supporting people ukraine making sure have democratic government allows for self-rule something think all this country want see happen but think one reasons has come head because last year--not last year but years ago previous administration--the senators from new hampshire connecticut were going after senator cruz other republicans for not paying attention this issue long time ago have been paying attention for long time but one thing has intensified attention fact russians now have tens thousands troops ukraine's border new issue issue think demands attention this body our country our government our state department american military conjunction with our allies region this critical time very important strong message sent not sure why would wait until after russians cross border occupy ukraine before something might deter kind bad behavior think reason have amassed troops have ukraine border because perceive change administration perhaps different view fact think buildup started spring 2021 under this administration just make point vote will have this afternoon senator cruz's proposal nord stream has been long time making--he has think consistently worked this issue advocated for this issue way any senator who trying get vote around here would think with respect why this issue now particularly relevant light our national security interests fact russians have literally tens thousands troops sitting ukraine's border time when world very dangerous place region particular faces considerable peril because neighborhood which live would hope this afternoon when this nord stream vote comes will enjoy broad bipartisan support recognizing value importance message sends also might add because was also pointed out two senators who were just here this something ukrainian government asking suggested this was something isn't desired wanted fact many participated conference call christmas eve with president zelensky which voiced support for this think his country his government his people realize how important message sent their neighbors american government concert with our allies this region send very strong statement with respect particular issue hope get good strong vote this afternoon won't party-line vote meaning will take some democrats vote with republicans but can't think time when stakes have been higher for people ukraine frankly for matter for region its entirety inflation president want shift gears now might yesterday learned december inflation hit its highest level years years inflation reached percent december seventh straight month inflation has been over percent today discovered year-over-year inflation for domestically produced goods increased even more massive 9.7 percent americans are struggling under steep increases grocery prices fuel prices utility prices list goes despite wage increases 2021 american families experienced facto pay cut with their purchasing power shrinking thanks inflation there apparently end sight given real economic harm american families are suffering result this crisis would think issue would front center here washington for democrats but would wrong fact lot time inflation doesn't even seem exist democrats radar democrats can't bothered pay attention real crisis with real economic consequences for american families because are too focused their manufactured voting rights crisis earlier this week president biden traveled georgia which has become democrats poster child for supposed assault voting rights deliver speech gin support for democrats partisan election bill what speech was course his overwrought bombastic remarks president who once vowed bring americans together managed imply half country racist never one let truth get way good story continued his bizarre habit falsely claiming had been arrested various situations laid out perhaps weakest case for voting rights crisis can imagine president course used georgia's thoroughly mainstream 2021 election law his main example here what had say here what voting rights crisis amounts first according president georgia making harder vote mail now guessing might referring provision georgia law asks voters write their driver's license numbers their absentee ballots given almost every american this country has driver's license some form photo page s202 have got say doesn't seem like unduly burdensome requirement after all new york city washington are now requiring present photo proof have been vaccinated before can enter any restaurant public place liberals seem with but apparently president georgia's measure jim crow 2.0 president continues accusing georgia limiting drop boxes ballot drop boxes have become bizarre fixation democrats engaged trying persuade americans right vote under attack truth georgia didn't even use drop boxes until election georgia's new election law now requires least one drop box each county hardly criminal attempt restrict drop boxes but let's honest here even georgia decided eliminate drop boxes entirely return its pre-2020 status quo georgians would still have ample opportunities vote georgia's new law mandates minimum days early voting--17 days--and georgia provides for no-excuse absentee voting which means any georgia citizen can request absentee ballot for any reason whatsoever course far more generous voting policy than those offered president senate democrat leader's home states president's home state delaware doesn't offer no-excuse absentee voting just starting offer early voting this year--remember georgia with days early voting no-excuse absentee voting similarly democrat leader's home state senator schumer's home state new york offers just days early voting contrast georgia's new york--the state new york--on their ballot recently rejected ballot measure allow no-excuse absentee voting no-excuse absentee voting not allowed new york but allowed georgia with days early voting new york georgia yet somehow president hasn't yet visited delaware new york accuse them making difficult for citizens vote will believe democrats supposed commitment protecting vote when see senate majority leader come floor excoriate new yorkers for attacking voting rights continuing with president biden's speech come perhaps most ridiculous example president democrats have used their attempt convince americans voting rights are under assault here going quote directly from president's speech t]he new georgia law actually makes illegal--think this--i mean it's now going into election--it makes illegal bring your neighbors your fellow voters food water while wait line vote mean think about that's not america that's what looks like when suppress right vote what looks like when suppress right vote really mean have give president biden credit for delivering line with straight face because pretty much most absurd claim democrats have made course this debate president course referring provision georgia's election law prohibits individuals organizations from giving food drinks voters within 150 feet polling place now just for purposes again comparing contrasting democrat leader's home state new york--senator schumer's home state new york--has similar provision preventing voters line from being given anything including food water whose retail value excess this state new york--the state new york but people are blowing gasket over this provision georgia law--the very provision state new york has law today would argue most states can't within certain number feet voting place are political operative political organization mean true our state sure true lot states around country aim those laws course prevent partisan political organizations candidates from exerting improper pressure voters line now nothing georgia's law prevents partisan political organizations from setting food trucks lunch stations outside 150-foot radius feeding voters their hearts content--150 feet yards course georgia's law explicitly allows nonpartisan poll workers make water available voters election worker somebody who involved with actual vote itself can deliver water voters are waiting line just prevents political operatives political organizations from doing that--a law again consistent with laws throughout country including--including--the state new york yet suppose typical nanny-state democrats think americans are incapable packing themselves snack pretty sure--pretty sure--i have never seen weaker case for crisis take look democrats supposed evidence their case crumbles dust which course raises question what behind democrats manufactured crisis unfortunately think know answer democrats have manufactured supposed voting rights crisis hopes forcing through election legislation hope will give them advantage future elections more than one democrat has openly admitted democrats want pass federal election takeover because think will help their party elections don't blame democrats for running scared between their inflation crisis their border crisis president's humiliating disastrous retreat from afghanistan november election results virginia fact just one-third american people approve job president doing democrats have reason scared about their 2022 electoral prospects filibuster president instead addressing inflation crisis helped create perhaps moving their agenda from far left closer center democrat leaders have decided solution improving their electoral chances pass partisan federal takeover election law break senate rules apparently don't care what damage senate country process democrat leaders have their way longstanding protections for minority senate millions upon millions americans senate minority represents will swept away name perhaps improving democrats electoral prospects although have say washington post fact checker about georgia law which way gave president four pinocchios--four pinocchios which pretty much biggest whopper can get--for his statements last year about this georgia election law went say analysts who have looked this--a lot analysis has been done so-called election experts--think will expand--expand--the opportunity for people georgia vote all this disheartening say least because think all know end are going blow senate rules has consequences for very very long time there are democrats this chamber today who still express think regret for what happened 2013 with respect executive calendar--which deals with executive branch nominees judicial branch nominees judges--because led 2017 republicans retaliating following suit with supreme court justices don't think can--assume for minute some point this flips democrats blow rules this create have say manufactured crisis order then are not going able blame republicans because once rules are gone rules are gone then become house representatives total majoritarian body with longer terms not what founders intended this place here for reason here represent rights minority people who didn't vote people who might minority party who ought have some say some voice laws are made here policies are made here are going affect them their families hopeful there are still some democrats with doubts about this course action enough perhaps block their leadership's partisan push page s203 his inaugural address president united states vowed president for all americans tuesday made clear becoming nothing more than president for far-left wing democratic party less than year has gone from promising unity sowing division sad epitaph presidency has barely begun yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll legislative clerk proceeded call roll cruz president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered 3436 cruz president eyes history are upon today each will faced with momentous question can put petty differences aside can come together defend our friend our ally ukraine against imminent russian aggression this isn't theoretical russian tanks troops are right now massed ukrainian border are preparing for invasion senate just few hours will vote bill represents best way deter putin from invading ukraine sanctioning company racing finish make operational nord stream pipeline which putin desperately wants completed can use cudgel against our european allies don't come together today ukraine risks getting wiped off map altogether putin didn't just wake one day decide wanted invade ukraine has wanted invade ukraine for years did already 2014 but stopped short full invasion because couldn't endanger ukraine's energy infrastructure which needs get russia's natural gas europe stopped putin from marching all way kiev next year 2015 putin began nord stream project--to build pipeline around ukraine could get his gas europe invade ukraine with risk billions relies every year nord stream know have heard from republicans from democrats--literally hundreds times over past years this floor committees briefings--nord stream was designed circumvent ukraine why senate has worked together for years bipartisan manner stop nord stream from coming online 2017 congress came together passed countering america's adversaries through sanctions act caatsa which sanctioned investments russian energy export pipelines 2019 congress passed protecting europe's energy security act peesa which sanctions nord stream directly authored bill along with democratic senator jeanne shaheen 2021 congress expanded those sanctions protecting europe's energy security clarification act again authored bill along with democratic senator jeanne shaheen for next several hours this body will revisit debate this issue once again will revisit our successes from 2019 2021 using targeted sanctions end construction pipeline when president trump signed our bipartisan sanctions into law putin stopped construction pipeline literally minutes before law became effective sanctions worked succeeded together bipartisan foreign policy national security victory but will also revisit this debate catastrophic decision president biden made may this year waive those sanctions sanctions had worked sanctions were successful president biden waived them nonetheless when this debate over each will have decide whether will vote finally definitively put end this pipeline through mandatory sanctions our ukrainian allies are crying out for ukraine's president prime minister speaker parliament have all explicitly passionately done recent days ukraine's prime minister said last week nord stream less existential threat ukraine's security democracy than russian troops our border prime minister ukraine begging this body u.s senate help him just this week public letter from leaders ukrainian civil society said--and want quote this length said since late october 2021 russia has amassed more than 120,000 troops close ukrainian border along with logistical support for major new offensive this menacing build-up had been accompanied increasing belligerent rhetoric from senior russian officials believe green light given nord stream pipeline may 2021 served one key triggers for current crisis must urgently revised ordinary times open letter from ukrainian civil society would resonate with both democrats republicans this plea for help opponents our legislation are clutching pretexts avoid doing what have done many times before want address those pretexts one time one argument have heard again again imposing sanctions nord stream gazprom-owned cutout runs nord stream would shatter european unity argument being repeated white house repeatedly--that this all about transatlantic unity should give putin its pipeline because transatlantic unity urge every senator ask simple question what unity with whom january european parliament voted condemn stop nord stream pipeline vote was 581 50--581 care about transatlantic unity let suggest side with 581 not biden white house's argument literally with name transatlantic unity don't know how stand make argument with straight face--581 august 2021 chairs foreign affairs committees nine countries opposed explicitly nord stream u.s.-german agreement--the biden agreement--to allow completion nord stream among those countries explicitly opposed agreement estonia czech republic ireland latvia lithuania poland ukraine united kingdom are those countries europe care about transatlantic unity with those countries are begging find courage stand vladimir putin when president biden made his deal allow pipeline through anyway foreign ministers ukraine poland issued remarkable joint statement declaring decision president biden made surrender putin created immediate security crisis for europe told then--ukraine poland both told then--that result waiving sanctions are going see russian troops were right almost understand their neighbor almost understand putin's desire reassemble soviet union almost believe vladimir putin when said believed greatest geopolitical disaster 20th century was dissolution soviet union wants bring back together force which would note would grave national security threat united states now some will say when say european unity really mean unity with germany indeed have heard members this floor say listen just not prepared sanction germany this bill doesn't sanction germany doesn't sanction german government doesn't sanction german company sanctions nord stream which wholly owned controlled gazprom this sanctioning russian cutout because this pipeline tool for putin's aggression europe even when comes unity germany what really mean unity with angela merkel will concede angela merkel wants this pipeline don't fully understand why but does but angela merkel longer chancellor germany indeed german people went page s204 polls voted her party out office one would think from united states extent are concerned about standing with ally should concerned about current government germany not former government should respect views german people now current government germany hopelessly fractured nord stream greens who are part this coalition government passionately oppose nord stream vocally repeatedly have condemned nord stream are integral part this german government but just few hours ago german defense minister other side said nord stream off table are not willing anything stop nord stream german chancellor has said same declaring seeks positive reset with putin this same putin who has tanks border ukraine preparing invade another argument will hear sanctions should kept our pockets should reserve them for use later case russian invasion would note this not what our ukrainian allies advocate have trouble believing anyone this chamber actually takes this argument seriously nor should putin doesn't putin believes once brings nord stream online once has changed region through invasion one will have will impose sanctions would note not crazy believe when biden administration first capitulated russia nord stream biden administration german government made promise said if--if if--russia uses energy for energy blackmail then will stop pipeline beat their chest with promise were quite bold about have had some members senate say well have got really strong promises from germany now well what has happened since then russia has nakedly unequivocally used energy for energy blackmail energy prices have skyrocketed europe putin openly boasting laughing saying well turn nord stream your energy prices will down not hiding not pretending did exactly what biden white house german government said will stop did openly brazenly laughingly absolutely nothing happened--zero crickets president ask reasonable man german government biden white house were unwilling impose sanctions when putin immediately triggered what said was their redline what universe would biden white house german government have greater resolve once millions germans are dependent russian natural gas from nord stream heat their homes when literally stopping germans from freezing death because ukrainian pipeline shut down becomes only viable source heat really think are going have greater courage then than have had far nobody does putin doesn't important understand debate before this chamber impose sanctions before invasion order stop invasion threaten sanctions after invasion done bill colleague senator menendez pushing would latter would impose sanctions after invasion completed don't think putin believes those sanctions would ever imposed but can tell ukrainian president zelensky has very expressly addressed this issue here what said only sanctions are applied prior armed conflict would become prevention mechanism for any possible escalation president ukraine begging members this senate vote favor bill floor today today will one our very last chances stop nord stream stop imminent russian invasion ukraine just few minutes ago two colleagues senator murphy senator shaheen had colloquy which explained why have flipped their positions every other democrat this chamber have voted for sanctions nord stream not once but twice every democrat voted support bipartisan sanctions nord stream only two things have changed since all democrats voted favor these sanctions occupant white house who now has behind his name instead white house furiously lobbying democrats asking democrats stand with their party--sadly expense our allies expense europe expense u.s national security merits this should very easy vote would suggest joe biden were not president donald trump were sitting oval office today every single democrat this chamber would vote for these sanctions--all them--as did twice when donald trump was sitting oval office other thing has changed way russian troops border ukraine which exactly what ukrainians poles told would happen when biden waived these sanctions those are two things have changed have say colleagues senators murphy shaheen had very odd colloquy because decided after personally instead focusing merits issue particular said know when trump was president senator cruz didn't hold his state department nominees over nord stream trump didn't impose sanctions over nord stream now recognize politics sometimes heat moment say things don't entirely think through them but even annals bad arguments singularly absurd argument true didn't hold state department nominees over nord stream true trump didn't impose sanctions why because stopped nord stream because were successful when authored bipartisan sanctions there were significant elements trump administration resisted department treasury fought mightily against was more than happy battle own party this because this was right thing for u.s national security there even one democrat with courage against his own party now other side argument didn't hold any nominees--why would hold nominees president trump signed bill have said from beginning biden imposes sanctions will lift all holds lifted holds december get this vote focus stopping this pipeline stopping putin russia their argument well trump didn't impose sanctions--that correct because putin stopped building pipeline remind timing president trump signed bill memory serves correctly p.m thursday night putin stopped building pipeline 6:45 p.m minutes beforehand there was nothing sanction because didn't commit sanctionable conduct stopped only returned building pipeline does presiding officer know what date putin began building deep-sea pipeline once again january 2021 days after joe biden was sworn into office putin knew biden was going what did waive sanctions surrender sanctions worked had bipartisan victory inexplicably this white house gave away want take minute speak democratic colleagues listen there are lots issues are going disagree with one another partisan matter fine will talk about tax rates whether should high low can have good vigorous arguments about part our democracy but this instance biden white house carrying out policy makes sense abandons our allies harmful american national security strengthens encourages aggression vladimir putin bully tyrant makes war much more likely most not all democratic colleagues know all this going page s205 ask democratic colleagues something hard which have courage stand take some partisan grief for voting against white house this one save white house from mistake are making one roles senate keep hearing analogy framers used saucer cool tempers moment senate did with president trump senate should with president biden well years u.s senate have taken lot votes presiding officer has taken lot votes there are very few votes think are consequential vote are getting ready take senate democrats put partisan loyalty above national security vote simply party line will dramatically increase chances violent russian invasion ukraine days weeks months from now turn television set see russian tanks streets kiev reason will u.s senate heard pleas our ukrainian allies turned deaf ear them pray don't eyes history are upon this body republicans democrats should rise occasion yield floor presiding officer senator from illinois voting rights durbin president earlier today republican senate leader came floor noted fact when american people were asked about issues moment didn't mention their right vote think most americans would surprised are even debating issue this moment american history know right vote has been contentious divisive deadly when comes policies this nation particularly policies individual states was one critical reasons addition hideous institution slavery went war among ourselves 600,000-plus americans gave their lives really was heart what happened after when north prevailed union was saved president united states man from illinois not only created emancipation proclamation but set stage for constitutional amendments which guaranteed right vote imagine some people would excused didn't list highest priority probably assume really not issue for debate but see this last presidential election had two three historic things occur first turnout american voters was unprecedented good thing democracy applauded each year should try improve outcome second thing though would have put liability column petulant former president who refused even acknowledge election instead claims was abused was stolen from him fanciful lie now making its way across america back forth former president trump peddles every quarter unfortunately some people are listening some percent american people agree with former president election was stolen from him couldn't argument any courtroom couldn't even convince his handpicked attorney general back him resorted sending mob his followers january 2021 storm this capitol for first time since 1812 were invaded people who did not subscribe basic tenets our constitution was grim day will never forget those who were here sure say same but set stage for campaign has followed for more than year this morning read paper some eight republican attorneys general are going close ranks trump-inspired alliance change election laws across america his liking shame them shame anyone who thinks what america all about should encourage more more those legally eligible vote should make easy exercise not hardship burden but states--almost them now--are process changing laws their states voting with each change law making more difficult doesn't sound too reprehensible its face until add all together notion people would have less time apply for absentee ballots fact would have come with good reason their applications for those ballots would have contain certain information which new sometimes challenging individuals limiting periods time people can vote limiting opportunity register vote special elections state georgia each one those additive factor reducing likelihood people will turn vote even this notion georgia can't provide food drink voters waiting line well hometown springfield vote park district there seldom wait more than minutes about average across america but know there are exceptions have seen people waiting line much longer fact one state found african americans waited line average minutes--not minutes idea perhaps giving someone drink water under those circumstances now against law georgia hard imagine just one things wanted add burdens voting america when come floor discuss voting republican leader tells people don't care--i bet will when come realize what happening interesting notes what care about--they care about coronavirus too didn't have check voting records know what about say true senator from kentucky every other senator side aisle voted against joe biden's american rescue plan beginning his administration had bold policy-driven piece legislation called american rescue plan which set out something had done yes had found vaccines but order produce them administer them needed program cost money joe biden stepped said this what are going are going get this jab this shot available americans across board are going spend money does good have formula can save your life yet can't access pay for put american rescue plan just made common sense didn't with many people dying sick have ambitious unprecedented historic administration vaccine across america was easy vote for for every democrat obviously easy other side for republicans because not single one including republican leader from kentucky would support president biden effort there was money there well keep businesses open could hire back their people back business don't know about presiding officer's state sure new jersey similar illinois but have talked lot restauranteurs who walked said senator never met before but hadn't voted give chance reopen this business wouldn't here today reality bill republicans all every single one voted against surprise come floor critical joe biden his presidency saying just doesn't understand real issues well coronavirus real issue president's response was real response sadly unanimous opposition president republican side aisle was also real response can remember coming out college hearing about voting rights act being debated right here floor u.s senate have said before floor--and won't belabor it--i have taken time over years understand what led reconstruction jim crow great migration all followed from friend--and friend--carol anderson professor emory university atlanta has written book called one person vote flattered asked page s206 write forward book which gladly did then read thought what incredible story tells about america battle vote remember--as mentioned was young fresh out college law school--when martin luther king came city chicago remember well because was midst working young man political campaign made all headlines when martin luther king decided walk through marquette park particular parade--that protest--drew violence from people dressed nazi uniforms throwing rocks him jeering those who supported his effort remember because nowadays when talk about martin luther king's day observance which coming next week people have tendency think gentle positive terms--and should but let's not forget price paid--ultimately his life--to deliver message divided america when talk about why did what meant one guiding factors was right vote his belief from reconstruction forward his day were still finding ways deny right vote african americans others this country was fundamental issue--an issue was willing give his life for for some martin luther king day will day reflection chance envision america what truly means free last but also day action let's hope have some action here floor u.s senate each day open session senate pledging allegiance flag good thing out respect gladly but don't stand here pledge allegiance filibuster filibuster senate rule not long its history interpretation what senate about has changed over years over over again not sacred not constitutional dictum fact best efforts politicians this chamber their day write rule establishes minimum vote what does mean well means lot senate divided 50-50--50 republicans democrats--it means there are measures which require votes used rare occurrence this body someone would invoke filibuster yet now has become virtually commonplace just look last years can see change senate dramatic orchestrated change senate what was uncommon requiring votes for measure has now become standard course what means very few things come floor senate when republicans were control just few years ago during course entire calendar year senate floor voted for amendments--26 normal history senate hundreds amendments are voted course year but because filibuster design many slow down stop business senate year voted for amendments--26 what happens when shut down debate what happens when shut down opportunity for amendments what happens when pledge allegiance filibuster have honest about this there should exception written for filibuster when comes voting rights something fundamental our constitutional authority vote should given day for argument floor senate should subject majority vote down not too much ask would rather pledge allegiance flag voting authority america represents than filibuster rule which has been misused much has been properly used its history there are many enduring victories can attribute king civil rights movement but civil rights act 1964 voting rights act 1965 are certainly high list these laws put stake heart jim crow expanding voting rights generations black americans prior passage these laws state legislators throughout deep south had disenfranchised voters color through whirlwind discriminatory legislation these laws didn't explicitly ban black americans from voting 15th amendment ratified during reconstruction prevented them from doing but soon enough these lawmakers discovered new ways discriminate against voters color decades after reconstruction erected barriers ballot box like poll taxes property ownership requirements literacy tests when comes jim crow laws easy get caught abstractions generic descriptions hear phrase literacy test was used even into 1960s america think well just means have read grade-school level right wrong poll test from louisiana parish had questions which struggle answer even today were designed make sure voters wouldn't able answer draw line around number letter this sentence what heck does mean share this example demonstrate what voter suppression looked like days king words historian carol anderson whom mentioned earlier tactics like literacy tests were legislative evil genius didn't disenfranchise voters basis their skin color outright but were only administered some voters can imagine which ones thank god members senate bipartisan basis decided 1960s outlaw this legislative sleight hand our predecessors didn't cave disingenuous cries states rights which hear this day republican side aisle our predecessors understood voting fundamental liberty should treated differently reason pledge allegiance flag because make decision under flag who governs right now millions american voters are facing new wave voter suppression laws much like proponents jim crow laws did their day republicans state lawmakers today are erecting new barriers ballot box latching onto myth widespread voter fraud what state legislative leaders are saying where could have come with idea possible disgruntled former president with bruised ego because his effort for reelection reality laws are passing these states are not about preventing voter fraud are about preventing eligible americans from voting nurse working back-to-back shifts election day single parent who doesn't own car can't afford babysitter person living with disability--should concerned whether have opportunity vote certainly should new laws enacted nearly states will prevent our most vulnerable neighbors from exercising their right vote why ought look senate rules isn't just matter some theoretical academic debate rules these are real-life decisions states across nation most troubling these laws take assault democracy even further give partisan actors more power meddle interfere election administration some proposals have seen can potentially allow partisans overrule valid votes american people anoint victor their own choosing over next few days expect many will quote excerpts king's most famous speeches hope will take heed words wrote letter from birmingham jail responded group white religious leaders who had pleaded with him his fellow civil rights advocates slow down wait little longer racial equality going follow soon response king wrote for years now i've heard word wait this wait has almost meant never must come see with one our distinguished jurists yesterday justice too long delayed justice denied continued we've waited for more than 340 years for our god given constitutional rights hope page s207 sirs can understand our legitimate unavoidable impatience issue are debating voting rights issue our rules not just casual conversation about rule book one hardly knows issue does heart our democracy our pledge allegiance flag not filibuster issue our republican colleagues are afraid this debate traditionally played key role passage voting rights act 1960s fact percentagewise there were more republican senators voting for than democratic senators say acknowledging democratic party those days was not altogether right side have been told are breaking senate change this rule protect people's right vote heart what senate what stands for reason exists right americans vote worth carve-out worth change worth modification senate rules protect right vote can anything more sacred yield floor presiding officer senator from arizona sinema president rise challenging divisive time for our nation for years america's politics have spiraled steadily downward into increasingly bitter tribal partisanship our democracy has been strained while may sound abstract problem hurts americans real tangible ways these deepening divisions hurt our ability work together create new job opportunities protect health safety our communities country ensure everyday families get ahead americans across country know this see every day not only social media cable news but their jobs around their dinner tables are divided more likely today look other americans who have different views see other even see them enemies instead fellow country men women who share our core values more common today demonize someone who thinks differently than rather than seek understand their views our politics reflect exacerbate these divisions making more more difficult find lasting broadly supported solutions safeguard our freedoms keep our country safe expand opportunity for all our citizens two questions face nation where does this descending spiral division lead how can stop our country's divisions have now fueled efforts several states will make more difficult for americans vote undermine faith all americans should have our elections our democracy these state laws have place nation whose government formed free fair open elections must also acknowledge painful fact state laws seek address are symptoms larger more deeply rooted problem facing our democracy--the divisions themselves which have hardened recent years have combined with rampant disinformation push too many americans away from our basic constitutional values spring 2017 after trump took office wrote opinion piece arizona republic highlighting concerns about strains our constitutional boundaries shrinking respect for our founding constitutional principles years followed colleagues this body were called upon participate two separate impeachment trials for crimes against our constitution january last year was standing this very spot speaking this very chamber defending arizona's fair valid election against disinformation when violent insurrectionists halted presidential certification threats american democracy are real share concerns civil right advocates others have heard from recent months about these state laws strongly support those efforts contest these laws court invest significant resources into these states better organize stop efforts restrict access ballot box strongly support will continue vote for legislative responses address these state laws--including freedom vote act john lewis voting rights advancement act senate currently considering support these bills because strengthen americans access ballot box better ensure americans votes are counted fairly through elections americans make their voices heard select their representatives guide future our country our communities these bills help treat symptoms disease but not fully address disease itself while continue support these bills will not support separate actions worsen underlying disease division infecting our country debate over senate's 60-vote threshold shines light our broader challenges there need for restate longstanding support for 60-vote threshold pass legislation there need for restate its role protecting our country from wild reversals federal policy view have held during years serving both u.s house senate view continue hold belief have shared many times public settings private settings senators both parties have offered ideas including some would earn support make this body more productive more deliberative more responsive americans needs place genuine debate about our country's pressing issues while this week's harried discussions about senate rules are but poor substitute for what believe could have--and should have--been thoughtful public debate any time over past year such discussion still worthy goal but discussion rules falls short what required american politics are cyclical granting power washington exchanged regularly voters from one party another this shift power back forth means senate 60-vote threshold has proved maddening members both political parties recent years--viewed either weapon obstruction safety net save country from radical policies depending whether serve majority minority but what legislative filibuster other than tool requires new federal policy broadly supported senators representing broader cross section americans--a guardrail inevitably viewed obstacle whoever holds senate majority but which reality ensures millions americans represented minority party have voice process demands eliminate this threshold--from whichever party holds fleeting majority--amount group people separated two sides canyon shouting solution their colleagues makes rift both wider deeper consider this recent years nearly every party-line response problems face this body every partisan action taken protect cherished value has led more division not less impact clear for all see steady escalation tit for tat which each new majority weakens guardrails senate excludes input from other party furthering resentment anger amongst this body our constituents home democrats increased use requiring cloture for traditional nominees under president george bush led similar tactics republicans under president barack obama 2013 decision senate democrats eliminate 60-vote threshold for most judicial presidential nominations led directly response 2017 senate republicans who eliminated threshold for supreme court nominees these shortsighted actions both parties have led our current american judiciary supreme court which stand here today considering questions regarding fundamental rights americans have enjoyed for decades eliminating 60-vote threshold--on party line with thinnest possible majorities--to pass these bills page s208 support will not guarantee prevent demagogues from winning office indeed some who undermine principles democracy have already been elected rather eliminating 60-vote threshold will simply guarantee critical tool need safeguard our democracy from threats years come clear two parties strategies are not working--not for either side especially not for country know comfortable for members each party particularly those who spent their career party politics think their respective party alone can move country forward party control becomes goal itself instead prioritizing healthy appropriate balance which americans diverse views shared values are represented but when one party needs only negotiate with itself policy will inextricably pushed from middle toward extremes understand there are some both sides aisle prefer outcome but not know arizonans not either our country's first president george washington leader whose wisdom borrowed conclusion impeachment trial--he warned against political factions more than 200 years ago saying extreme partisanship could lead ruins public liberty was party man myself washington wrote first wish heart was parties did exist reconcile them today serve equally divided senate today marks longest time history senate has been equally divided house representatives nearly equally divided well our mandate seems evident work together get stuff done for america past years have shown when party control pushes party line changes exceeding their electoral mandate bitterness within our politics exacerbated tensions are raised within country traditionally nonpartisan issues are transformed into partisan wedges must address disease itself--the disease division--to protect our democracy cannot achieved one party alone cannot achieved solely federal government response requires something greater yes more difficult than what senate discussing today need robust sustained strategies put aside party labels focus our democracy because these challenges are bigger than party affiliation must commit long-term approach serious problems seek solve--one prioritizes listening understanding one embraces making progress shared priorities finding common ground issues where hold differing diverse views this work requires all americans everywhere efforts fix these problems bare-majority party line will only succeed exacerbating root causes gave way these state laws first place extending our dissent into more fragmented america this work our shared responsibility americans share disappointment many have not found more support other side aisle for legislative responses state-level voting restrictions wish were not case just wish there had been more serious effort part democratic party leaders sit down with other party genuinely discuss how reforge common ground these issues republican colleagues have duty meet their shared responsibility protect access voting integrity our electoral process need sustained robust effort defend american democracy effort part democrats republicans independents all americans communities across this country ask what must protect our democracy should invest heavily recruiting supporting state local candidates for office--in both parties--who represent values enshrined our constitution should ensure have judiciary less lopsided its political leanings can all depend uphold constitution must confront combat rise rampant disinformation ensure all americans have tools see fact from fiction this will particularly difficult work since some power have used disinformation manipulate our differences pull americans apart pressuring see our fellow americans enemies dangers facing our democracy took years metastasize will take years sustained focused effort effectively reverse there are steps can take today fix our politics better set stage for repairing our democracy many know began career social worker our social work training our first necessary skill ability listen others--listening not argue rebut but listening understand ran for u.s senate rejecting partisanship willing work with anyone help arizonans build better more secure lives throughout time serving arizona have listened arizonans expressing diverse views inflation economic competitiveness climate social priorities role federal government itself find myself grateful time time again learn from arizonans who share same core values but differ position issues policies their similarities their differences are surely representative complexity americans nationwide find this question answers itself can two americans sharp intellect good faith reach different conclusions same question yes yes course can easy for elected officials give speeches about what believe harder listen acknowledge there are whole lot americans with different ideas about what important our country how solve those problems yet important recognize disagreements are are normal honest disagreements matched with willingness listen learn can help forge sturdy enduring solutions know congress was designed bring together americans diverse views representing different interests collective find compromise common ground serve our country whole face serious challenges meeting them must start with willingness honest listen one another lower political temperature seek lasting solutions some have given goal easing our divisions uniting americans have not have worked hard demonstrate public service value working with unlikely allies get results helping others see our common humanity finding our common ground remain stubbornly optimistic because this america have overcome every challenge have ever faced committed doing part avoid toxic political rhetoric build bridges forge common ground achieve lasting results for arizona this country but are desperate need more more people who are willing listen seek understanding stitch together fabric our country has been ripping around edges more people who are willing put down sticks sharpened for battle instead pick their neighbors learn why are angry upset left behind call each americans let those people are but one country have but one democracy can only survive can only keep her together presiding officer senator from kentucky 3436 paul president rise today speak against sanctioning german russian businesses over transport natural gas between their countries proponents sanctions say sanction this sanction department treasury currently administering dozens sanctions programs designed change behavior certain countries yet one seems ask important questions sanctions promote peace understanding escalate tension between nations what behavior has china modified since united states began sanctions has russia changed page s209 her behavior has russia given back crimea sanctions although lacking proof effectiveness are very popular with both parties embargoes sanctions big brother also garner bipartisan enthusiasm u.s embargo cuba has now gone for more than years without any evidence change regime even change regime's policy embargoes are often described especially embargoed country act war many historians say u.s.'s embargo 1807 ultimately led war 1812 president jefferson's embargo was intended punish france england for their aggressions but instead embargo crippled american shipping exports exports declined percent some historians also blame u.s embargo japan for ensuing war roosevelt seized many japan's assets japan access much its international trade over percent its imported oil effectively least from perspective japan embargo was act war yet enthusiasts for embargoes sanctions still clamor for more sanctionistas point international sanctions against iran lever brought about obama-era nuclear agreement with iran perhaps but equally valid argument could made was extension carrots rather than sticks brought iran table funny how diplomacy seems require give-and-take not just take take take our interaction with iran should illuminate today's debate over sanctions nord stream pipeline between russia germany but shade mercantilism dimming light experience opponents pipeline not surprisingly are largely from states compete sale natural gas this more about protectionism than national security reports are pipeline will cause significant reduction u.s exports liquid natural gas hence keen interest people representing states sell natural gas this not much about national security about protectionism acknowledging this debate only superficially about national security really more about provincial protectionism helps better understand dynamics history demonstrates trade interconnectedness between nations barrier war engaging mutually beneficial commerce coupled with potent military deterrence combination best promises peace over past decade congress presidents have heaped sanctions russia china when have asked state department officials who come before our committee reveal what behavioral changes have come about result sanctions have often gotten blank stares now sanctionistas want sanction already completed pipeline last year said put sanctions will stop them well senate house overwhelmingly passed sanctions got sanctions still completed pipeline but what behavior are now asking russia change what specifically has russia been asked what russian action necessary for these sanctions end have asked sponsor this bill sanctions want russia what behavior--what want from russia response don't want any behavioral changes from russia word for-word response from sponsors this bill just want russia not ship oil germany about trade about trade might compete with certain natural gas-producing states has nothing with national security nord stream sanctions were really about changing russian behavior deterring aggression ukraine then nato including germany could threaten sanctions russia invades ukraine now that--the threat sanctions with germany ally--might actually have deterring value fact last summer united states germany did just united states germany announced agreement which said jointly any attempt use energy weapon commit further aggressive acts against ukraine will met with sanctions this germany united states together has power our little pinprick sanctions saying don't like are going punish companies are involved will nothing actually work with germany have deterring value germany could turn off spigot natural gas like valid threat from germany with together might able deter russia but simply turning gas pipeline off now sanctioning like being hostage taker saying don't want this have your hostage then going ahead shooting hostage before get what want should threaten sanctions threat sanctions has power once turn them have plan turn them off have leverage over russia nothing commitment agreement between germany united states--the agreement says this commitment designed ensure russia will not misuse any pipeline including nord stream achieve aggressive political ends will met with sanctions this could deterrence more countries got together said this--an international community sanctions can have some effect one-country sanctions particularly against its ally germany will have effect rush impose sanctions now undermines threat sanctions deter russian aggression against ukraine when put sanctions now offer them nothing way remove sanctions how are deterring anything fact might well make them angry enough actually act response sanctions opposite what have intended today's debate unfolds think will find sanctions against nord stream are more about mercantilism protectionism than national security presiding officer senator from wyoming barrasso president first would like ask unanimous consent able speak for minutes followed senator sullivan who floor for minutes then senator sasse for minutes before scheduled recess presiding officer without objection ordered barrasso president would hope everyone this body has listened senator sinema's important speech filibuster just now really appreciated her clear-eyed rationale--her rationale preserve minority voices this body find common ground this chamber thank her president also come floor today support sanctions vladimir putin's nord stream pipeline now urge all colleagues vote support 3436 protecting europe's energy security implementation act know last week president ukraine prime minister ukraine endorsed this legislation prime minister said following nord stream less existential threat our security democracy than russian troops our border senators shouldn't vote protect russia nord stream this security matter not only for ukraine but for entire region believe prime minister ukraine exactly right nord stream gas pipeline being built gazprom for people who aren't familiar with gazprom russian state-owned natural gas company now pipeline would double amount russian gas going germany via baltic sea this pipeline existential threat our ally ukraine threat our allies europe well right now vladimir putin has mobilized 100,000 troops border ukraine can afford this because flush with cash rising energy prices reduced american production mean vladimir putin has hit energy economic jackpot world now more dependent russian oil energy gas starts flow through this pipeline vladimir putin will get even richer more powerful world will become even more dependent him dictator page s210 vladimir putin uses energy geopolitical weapon uses energy coerce our allies our partners europe stopping this pipeline should area bipartisan agreement fact was area bipartisan agreement this very body until joe biden became president many democrats body voted for sanctions first time around even joe biden opposed pipeline before became president congress has overwhelmingly passed several pieces bipartisan legislation imposing sanctions this russian pipeline yet biden administration refuses implement these laws biden administration has now been actively lobbying this body actively lobbying congress against this bill democrats must think would give putin what wants don't get think give putin what wants then going play nice not going happen every american president must negotiate from standpoint position american strength vladimir putin cunning opportunistic aggressive respects strength not statements when sees opportunity takes can smell weakness pipeline will mean enormous transfer wealth--wealth from our allies our enemy will make our allies weaker will make putin stronger putin gets stronger know will get even more aggressive time now for this body stand up--stand against russia time sanction this pipeline yield floor presiding officer senator from alaska sullivan president want commend colleague from wyoming senator barrasso who has been leader many these issues senator cruz his bill this important piece legislation are going voting here couple hours this nord stream sanctions bill not just about immediate crisis ukraine but this would continuation long-term bipartisan american strategy deals with russia energy security american security want provide little broader context bipartisan strategy put this debate vote are having here today into context u.s commitment european security all know ironclad fought two world wars cold war protect our interests free open europe expanded nato secure those gains prevent russia from ever building new empire could threaten our allies all know russian power not just function military power contrary vladimir putin russians for decades have been using energy terms power energy weapon matter fact their weapon choice many instances europe let provide few recent examples look this map one pipeline actually not depicted so-called brotherhood pipeline from russia into ukraine goes into europe russians have cut off supplies natural gas other pipelines going through ukraine 2006 2008 2014 2015 moldova shortly after defeat pro-russian government election pro-western one russia did what normally cut off gas country not just impacting countries like ukraine when these gas supplies were cut off russia--because vladimir putin was angry about something--it impacted over countries with regard those cutoffs happening even today just yesterday head international energy agency paris said russia already right now strategically limiting natural gas europe during this very cold winter pressure european nations not support ukraine russians amass tens thousands troops their border speak for these reasons has been longstanding bipartisan american policy two things relates energy security first have sought dating back 1980s block implementation major pipelines from russia--from then-soviet union into europe reagan administration did this with sanctions 1982 have continued work this element our policy other element american bipartisan policy relates european energy security has been help countries--former soviet union countries particularly caspian central asia area--to provide their own energy outlets terms natural gas oil europe through southern corridor--the btc pipeline these are all areas democrats republicans have been involved with terms energy supplies our european allies don't through russia some diplomacy here these pipelines started with clinton administration which did very good job this had opportunity assistant secretary state charge economic energy issues bush administration lead efforts these southern corridor pipelines were successful right now these pipelines are providing energy our allies europe don't through russia start countries like azerbaijan through georgia through turkey this has been very bipartisan supported senate russians hate this hate why because doesn't give them any control over energy into europe mentioned today's vote actually part long-term bipartisan american strategy for decades have been pursuing because know russians use energy--particularly natural gas weapon how have been doing this well end trump administration were very good position european energy security two key areas first senator barrasso mentioned had strong--very strong--bipartisan support with regard nord stream sanctions its construction operations had overwhelming republican democrat support for sanctions are going voting today 2021 ndaa ndaa--very big very bipartisan another reason were set very well terms eurasian energy security end trump administration had achieved longstanding bipartisan goal american national security economic security energy security what was energy independence once again had become world's energy superpower what mean that--largest producer oil bigger than saudi arabia largest producer natural gas bigger than russia one biggest producers renewables world this bipartisan goal with regard european security why was important because answered huge question europeans often said are going block nord stream russian gas into germany other places europe where are going get gas well had answer are going get your gas america our exports lng liquefied natural gas surged take care this problem this good thing terms environment climate u.s lng exports europe have 41-percent lower emissions profile than russian gas pipelines europe good for environment climate national security energy security here another area this big production american energy was something people who know vladimir putin best knew was one biggest things could couple years ago was meeting with colleague whom miss very much here senator mccain russian dissident--a very famous russian dissident very end meeting asked what more can undermine putin regime know what said looked eye without hesitation said produce more american energy thing can undermine putin regime did did these are all things addition strengthening our own military addition giving ukrainians javelin missile systems--all these things were putting good position putin seemed very much box certainly wasn't threatening ukraine with tens thousands troops page s211 border where are today these key areas just mentioned well are not such good shape terms energy independence this administration seems focused actually destroying production american energy--oil gas particular guarantee dictators moscow well beijing can hardly believe their luck seems like president biden wants undermine very bipartisan goals had for decades american energy independence united states world's energy superpower again just think about what seeing canceled pipelines keystone pipeline canada united states president green-lighting nord stream killing energy production great states like mine just monday there were more obstacles produce energy alaska now are importing two times much oil from russia were year ago helping putin hurting united states what about nord stream where looked strong just past few years with this body strong bipartisan way sanctioning pipeline right there president biden has green-lighted but don't have point this vote today again this vote not just about current crisis ukraine about continuing long-term bipartisan approach eurasian energy security would make our european allies less vulnerable russian energy blackmail which has not only gone back decades literally happening right now just listen mentioned international energy agency's report yesterday this topic honest also about more political question this vote today many democratic colleagues suddenly became very hawkish against russia putin these issues other issues during trump years welcomed their conversion more hard-line approach but always begged question was more hawkish conversion principled one because realized being tough putin terms energy our military was best way achieve american national interests was this conversion more temporary one depending who occupied white house hope not latter but today's vote will answer for some senators who are looking change their recent votes but clearly some colleagues just few years ago who were voting sanction stop nord stream pipeline were sounding very tough vladimir putin russia are now bit quandary vote differently today not surprisingly are making arguments rationalize this new position would like review briefly just few those senator murphy has been down floor junior senator from connecticut with lot these arguments respect him thoughtful voice foreign policy don't always agree with him but serious voice but his arguments this issue right now are not very persuasive powerful here thing saying right now this isn't about russia quoting senator murphy this about cruz-trump agenda break atlantic alliance cruz-trump agenda break atlantic alliance now look clearly trying make boogeyman here called cruz-trump agenda but serious people who have been working these issues for decades know what are doing today continuation long-term bipartisan support for really important energy security policy for united states our european allies this continuing longstanding approach know his quote cruz-trump agenda said this actually about keeping atlantic relationship going save ukraine from invasion save ukraine from invasion but where president ukraine this issue what does president ukraine who knows little bit about power politics putin think about what are doing today supports sanctions supports sanctions nord stream where senator murphy starting dig little deeper his weak arguments trying provide cover for his colleagues who are going change their vote had respond where president zelensky ukraine was here what senator murphy said about i'm big supporter president zelenskyy but often misreads american politics think would have been better for him have stayed out this one wow leader country right here whom many think this all about who certainly knows what russian energy power politics are about since has been pointy end weapon many times now have senator saying president zelensky sit down quiet stay out this one don't want hear from even though this about saving your country--unless course support his position nord stream these are very weak arguments senator from connecticut most legitimate argument have heard some democratic friends make switching their vote their previous nord stream sanctions germans--a very important ally all agree that--don't want apply nord stream sanctions argument should all consider this what have heard secretary blinken national security advisor sullivan have been telling senators this week lobby against this vote are going take although early year was reported press both them actually supported nord stream sanctions here thing argument actually hard tell what germans really want fact what germans really want seems changing hour there was recent change government germany new foreign minister herself has said country should not grant nord stream regulatory approval order resist russian blackmail energy prices this current foreign minister germany also important remember where rest european union there broad opposition europe nord stream european parliament voted last year overwhelming cross-party basis--581 50--in favor canceling entire project wake arrest alexei navalny russian democracy leader whom putin first tried kill before locking away prison european parliament has voted least four further times other resolutions call halt this very project which what are looking vote today finally outsourcing this very important foreign policy national security american issue germans simply not wise germans have not always been clean levelheaded when comes russian gas gazprom nord stream what talking about well course talking about former chancellor germany gerhard schroder--one biggest betrayers west certainly last century left his chancellorship become putin's gazprom lapdog main lobbyist who pushing russian gas all over germany europe embarrassment atlantic alliance has been chairman for many years gazprom this former chancellor germany course has influenced germans say this good has made millions doing way should sanctioned with other putin cronies end day this shouldn't outsourced germany what need take vote what right for american national security vote sanctions this pipeline would consistent with long-term very bipartisan american-eurasian energy security policy make mistake colleagues nord stream putin's pipeline let's not make his lifeline encourage all colleagues what have done recently last couple years which vote overwhelming bipartisan manner sanction nord stream pipeline yield floor presiding officer senator from nebraska filibuster sasse president first want commend senior senator page s212 from arizona for extraordinary stand courage just great speech floor few minutes ago rise today defend filibuster again from latest round attacks did this repeatedly last administration earning ire frustration president own party over over again defended senate's purpose supermajority requirements forge consensus big broad diverse continental nation today rise defend filibuster again when president other party who has decided full demagogue for his entire career senate--basically joe biden served this body long have been alive plus minus few years--joe biden was stalwart defender filibuster said weakening filibuster would eviscerate senate but earlier this week president was pushed around bunch rage-addicted somethings his staff agreed down georgia just read whatever nonsense loaded into his teleprompter was shameful was sad president united states called half country bunch racist bigots think about that--half country bunch racist bigots doesn't believe this was senile comment man who read whatever was loaded into his teleprompter his speechwriters puppet-mastered him into saying anyone who disagrees with him george wallace bull connor jefferson davis disagree with joe biden are jefferson davis pretty breathtaking equating millions americans some ugliest racists all american history isn't just overheated rhetoric disgusting smear does president biden really believe this his heart hearts based conversations have had with him over years don't think believes this all let's back last year candidate joe biden ran for office promising would unify country why man was elected--because said crap went through last years was wrong said was going try unify country but now has decided surrender tiny little far-left group mistaken belief loudest voices twitter actually represent america would useful for pause recognize overwhelming majority all political tweets america come from less than 1\1/2 percent americans let's just say again because there are bunch morons around this building who have decided take their twitter feed reality not reality what president said georgia was nonsense joe biden with his decades u.s senate knows president will coming capitol hill next hour president biden really believes jim crow same thing lot states have decided reconsider some their covid expansion policies around voting--that jim crow redeliberating about covid expansions are same thing--he needs make argument person joe manchin really big racist joe biden apparently thinks kyrsten sinema really racist--if what animates kyrsten sinema--in eyes joe biden should have courage say their faces not going say their faces because doesn't believe ron klain has army twitter trolls has decided are reality has decided have president biden become something completely different than person who ran for office last year who served for decades u.s senate fact joe biden really believes joe manchin kyrsten sinema are bigots why has not called for them kicked out his party are racist bull connor jefferson davis why does joe biden want them his party stuff said georgia nonsense wouldn't say regular americans new jersey west virginia arizona nebraska because not true fact joe biden really believes lisa murkowski george wallace tim scott bull connor susan collins are jefferson davis would hope would have guts come say our faces but will not because this performative politics was nonsense everybody knows goes away after this weekend but chuck schumer might have primary from aoc really useful shift blame for his disastrous leadership senate over last months from himself kyrsten sinema joe manchin really what happening right now president biden ought have courage stand his own staff ought enough man apologize senate american people for nonsense said georgia vast majority what said violating ninth commandment disparaging people was not what really believes wouldn't say face-to-face this fiasco was ugly was entirely unnecessary makes sense federalize our elections right now way can differ with about can believe federalizing all elections good idea--it our constitutional system--but demonize people racist bigots because are not favor federalizing elections pretty bizarre leap let's just review little bit history last year had president who disgraced his office trying steal election what stopped our decentralized state-based systems elections are what stopped last year's attempt steal election makes absolutely sense try into nuclear partisanship now when should actually talking about how prevent another january doing hard actual bipartisan work--not grandstanding for twitter but hard bipartisan work reforming electoral count act which 130 years old obviously doesn't work well should reform electoral reform act this about subversion election not suppression there are real problems our electoral system could doing work actually fix try stop institutional arsonists congress who want build political brands wreckage american institutions could real work president decided something completely different this week here silver lining president biden leader schumer everybody this body know charade have been going through for last days great for 1\1/2 percent people addicted rage twitter get there are 1\1/2 percent people who get their jollies out this bad for america just undermining public trust elections what donald trump did last year but here thing everybody going through this charade knows dies this weekend why because members democrats own conference know there exception way senate rules work every single senator knows filibuster not going die this weekend every senator knows would nonsense rhetoric about one exception--it like losing your virginity just once--is not really how works once filibuster goes for goes for goes for today election centralization tomorrow gun politics next day climate debates every red-hot issue american culture american politics would same exception because every issue would just urgent next week next month next year fortunately senator manchin knows this senator sinema knows this way whole bunch more colleagues mine democratic party also know this just don't have much courage say public those two whole bunch colleagues--i tried count this morning between colleagues democratic party--have privately told regret following harry reid over tribalist cliff summer 2013 for just one exception judicial confirmations circuit court appeals think democrats have privately told regret this why because one-time exception now how entire executive calendar works everybody knew when harry reid set this page s213 place fire 2013 was what was going produce exact same thing would happen legislative calendar with supposed one-time carve-out for legislative filibuster let's remember what this institution for what senate supposed about are supposed one part congress one part american government thinks beyond month window job people who serve this body--only 100 people right now only think 2,100 people across 230-some years u.s history only 2,000 people have had honor serving our states this body supposed our job take long term view not just hours twitter are supposed think beyond months next election what our job supposed there are lot people around this place who apparently can't think beyond hours right now their right but shouldn't senators because purpose this place supposed take long-term view some colleagues are convinced americans are polarized because congress doesn't act more faster think solution supposedly eliminate filibuster are kidding themselves would not extinguish fires red-hot tribalism this country would throw gasoline them addressing real tribal disease america requires senate becomes less tribal not more tribal senator sinema's speech should commended every member this body back read said there are two fundamental questions before today one where does descent into tribalism this institution ultimately land what can each stop those are two big questions said should before today getting rid filibuster means this means turn one razor-thin majority imposing its will american people legislation into pendulum-swinging another razor-thin majority months later sweeps all aside jerks american people around opposite legislation what was just passed 50--51-50 today's senate all flips months from now legislation all gets undone new legislation gets put place really think regular folks new jersey nebraska want hardly any them want imagine what current situation would look like have federally imposed whiplash our most sensitive issues inside every months think tribalism bad now guarantee can make worse eliminating filibuster accelerates descent into tribalism there place course where simple majorities rule right down hallway have house representatives already does anybody want make argument place healthier than are because simple majoritarian body plain see age hyperpartisanship social media grandstanding house being more more ruled demagogues dolts not what senate called senate supposed different place senate supposed place where passions are tempered refined people who are responsible for thinking beyond our next election which why every election cycle america only has one-third senators even for reelection whole reason have 6-year terms had will could king for day write some constitutional amendments pass them would have single 12-year senate term everybody would out here little bit longer than years but one term reelection get back life back serving your community get rid filibuster will turn senate into house will ensure this body too ends consumed demagogues conspiracists clowns what will happen this body american people don't have time for crap nobody wants americans don't want one-party rule democrats republicans both these parties are really crappy american people are not fans these political parties getting rid filibuster means don't have try talk people other side aisle get 60-vote threshold for legislation 67-vote threshold for rules changes means one these two terrible parties gets lot more stuff lot faster will inevitably incredibly unpopular with american people american people not want revolution not want fundamental change what want competence what want more honesty what want less performative grandstanding institutions like senate provide frameworks processes for competent responsible self-government for more honesty are not living right now but could live down something worse ending filibuster would accelerate would accelerate tribalism would accelerate people following senators into bathrooms screaming them trying bully them will not lead more productive compromise legislation tries bring along larger share american public rules norms this place have been built over very long time exist discourage demagoguery putting cameras every room are around here tries undermine much what senate about for lots transparency for pen-and-pad reporters everywhere but cameras have put this place have encouraged much demagoguery much problem why have much tribalism here tribalism more broadly country eliminate filibuster accelerate all those most destructive short-term performative trends encourage more rank partisanship discourage consensus compromise collaboration friends please not--like president did georgia this week surrender angriest voices social media mistaken belief reflect majority america don't reflect majority twitter political twitter like ninth most popular topic twitter pop music exponentially more popular twitter than politics share americans paying attention political twitter bounces around between one-tenth one-sixth something like percent all political tweets come from under percent public should remind ourselves again again again because there are people here who regularly mistake twitter with reality with american public are called serve american public are not called serve rage-addicted people social media now perhaps more than ever our job stop giving ear political arsonists who would burn down our institutions intensify our divisions now time for think together over long term how renew those institutions filibuster part what can lead broader consensus eliminating filibuster will accelerate political arson around this place across our

bring him down their level says matthew sheffield former conservative activist who now runs political commentary website called flux.community know can get him call people moron engage pettiness way engage pettiness constantly--if does even once then it's victory for them paul disputes this characterization claims fauci deserves some culpability for pandemic because grant from his agency funded research lab wuhan chinese city where novel coronavirus was first detected exact origins virus remain unknown scientific consensus points animal-to-human transfer but debate ongoing marshall's office did not have comment sheffield's theory after hearing senator's campaign website did start selling t-shirts featuring doctor's likeness commemorate moment send fauci message getting your own moron t-shirt way which united states funds manages science provides solid foundation for skepticism conspiracy says university pennsylvania professor kathleen hall jamieson who studies science communication misinformation yes scientific recommendations change based available data truth can exploited make responsible leaders appear inconsistent incompetent yes fauci has high salary government standards has been same unelected position for years oversees budget billion flows into grants those are truths which distrusting person could build theory about corruption unaccountable elites nefarious flow money from this institution this lab yes virus seems unaccountable our best efforts fueled our worst instincts yes ways has ended upended people's lives have been undeserved tragic crazy making these are scary truths can neutralize with fantasy about how single human villain blame attacks misinformation seem having effect confidence fauci softening according polling conducted since april annenberg public policy center after holding steady last summer autumn percentage americans who are confident fauci provides trustworthy information about covid-19 down six points since april from percent for first time lifetime--and elderly woman--the voice speaks behalf best available knowledge science has weathered sustained attack says jamieson director policy center

his own voice exhausted two years on-camera appearances sen marshall exaggerated this erosion during jan hearing you've your reputation told fauci adding american people don't trust words coming out your mouth that's real distortion reality fauci answered marshall replied with truth from world outside medical science perception reality fauci not naive gets third country won't hear him still understands washington enough see how deteriorating new disturbing ways fringe thinking spreads central organs peter staley puts because one party has turned anti-science tony's power longer stable yet fauci still thinks effective messenger still hasn't totally given people who are making his life miserable after exchange with marshall news cycle dominated moron instead omicron fauci told his own incredulous staff maybe senator has point maybe financial investments though disclosed available should much easier see for citizens who wish him harm can't help but search for some signal some symptom could help him understand i'm always looking for good people kernel something that's positive fauci says it's tough imagine many people are bad people mean it's just--has something been

steps supreme court threatened two justices name will pay price shouted won't know what hit month ago after precedent-breaking leak draft opinion top democrats intensified reckless talk hillary clinton said court was poised kill subjugate women leader schumer speaker pelosi said court would ripp[ing constitution some most powerful people country pushing total hysteria over possibility justices may--may overturn decision even justice ruth bader ginsburg said was badly reasoned far-left activists publicized justices private addresses encouraged angry people flock their homes president biden his white house were asked condemn these intimidation tactics refused wrote attorney general garland about month ago asking why wasn't enforcing laws books already against judicial intimidation look everybody saw where this climate might lead yesterday morning u.s marshals arrested deranged person who traveled washington from california order assassinate supreme court justice his house has reportedly been charged with attempted murder fbi says would-be assassin was armed equipped for break-in told authorities was trying think about how give his life purpose apparently was only when came across justice's address posted online occurred him attempt murder-suicide explained his problem with this justice was ideological citing abortion second amendment while this would-be assassin was making his plan traveling across page s2877 country house democrats have spent weeks--weeks--blocking bipartisan legislation strengthen security for justices their families this bipartisan bill passed senate unanimously early may chairman durbin strong supporter but inexplicably--inexplicably this urgent uncontroversial bill has been sitting speaker pelosi's desk ever since same house democrats whose irresponsible rhetoric has contributed this dangerous climate are themselves blocking added security for justices their spouses their children even last night--last night--even after this arrest was made even after leftwing group published ominous social media post concerning school justice's children attend when leader mccarthy asked consent pass uncontroversial bill house democrats objected meanwhile biden department justice under attorney general garland continues flatly ignore section 1507 criminal code which would appear make federal crime protest homes federal judges influence them over pending case law right now this has been shameful disturbing two-step from washington democrats first use reckless rhetoric helps fuel dangerous climate then refuse their jobs address problem same far left has spent years trying improperly pressure court now aiding abetting this illegal intimidation campaign through total inaction why won't president biden call his supporters leave justices alone president biden call your supporters leave justices alone why won't attorney general united states enforce existing law why won't speaker stop blocking bipartisan security bill passed senate unanimously hard avoid concluding perhaps some democrats may want this dangerous climate hanging over justices heads finish this term--a disgraceful--disgraceful--dereliction duty this antithetical rule law speaker house attorney general must honor their oaths constitution their jobs understand democrats want stage big spectacle this week about what claim their opposition political violence but reality are going out their way block concrete steps prevent political violence foreign policy madam president now entirely separate matter year ago yesterday biden administration announced its withdrawal from afghanistan had reached halfway point analysis after analysis has confirmed what was clear many real time president's shoddy plans for reckless pullout were doomed disaster from start back february army investigation found run-up president biden's botched retreat his senior national security diplomatic advisers were not seriously planning for evacuation not paying attention what was happening ground army investigation withdrawal last month special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction blasted administration's bad judgment before congress explained removing u.s military contractor support our afghan partners was single most important factor collapse--the collapse--of afghanistan's resistance taliban not just this giant policy failure should have been foreseeable biden administration was fact foreseen experts spent months warning president's policies would create chaos spent months saying very same thing now many worst predictions about aftermath are coming true before our eyes our country our partners are facing needlessly heightened risk from terrorists because how biden administration botched afghanistan yet administration still denial letter congress just yesterday commander chief claimed united states remains postured address threats both our homeland our interests may arise from inside afghanistan but reality pentagon leaders have been clear about dramatic ways withdrawal has limited our ability identify target strike terrorists afghanistan former commander u.s central command says forcing u.s air assets travel longer distances reach afghan airspace means severely limiting time can spend actually performing counterterrorism missions--just predicted brandnew report from lead inspector general for our ongoing counterterrorism operations further confirms biden administration's mistakes have put way way behind curve without human intelligence bases country united states already suffering from less insight into emerging terror threats our sources are drying just predicted haven't conducted single strike against military target afghanistan since last military personnel left kabul isn't because there aren't any terrorists there report confirms because logistical challenges limited intelligence taliban-haqqani government kabul not just state sponsor terrorism literally government made terrorists kidnappers with deep ties qaeda even biden team continues pretend over-the-horizon operations are not inadequate afghanistan are implicitly acknowledging same insufficiency other theaters last month president biden redeployed u.s troops somalia reestablishing limited but real presence intended help local partners prevent their country from becoming terrorist haven president biden's own actions somalia give rise false claims afghanistan point fact longest term vision about counterterrorism this white house has managed lay out their obsession--obsession--with someday shutting down guantanamo bay detention center entirely have yet hear any coherent plans for what biden administration intends with dangerous killers currently held there will continue rely third countries detain terrorists strategy made possible taliban's massive jailbreak thousands hardened terrorists from bagram after this administration fled afghanistan does administration intend send terrorists syria held indefinitely nongovernmental entity like syrian defense forces case how long biden administration prepared remain syria make sure isis hezbollah assad regime can't facilitate another giant jailbreak american people our coalition partners deserve clear coherent counterterrorism strategy leaves our homeland safer our partnerships stronger biden administration providing unfortunately exactly opposite suggest absence quorum acting president pro tempore clerk will call roll senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded call roll thune madam president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded acting president pro tempore without objection ordered u.s supreme court thune madam president before begin would like express dismay house democrats decision last night block legislation provide enhanced security for supreme court justices their families due unprecedented leak early draft supreme court's dobbs decision resulting hysteria from members pro-abortion left supreme court asked congress for additional authorities protect justices families this happened weeks ago yesterday's arrest armed man near justice kavanaugh's home--a man who told police intended kill supreme court justice has been charged with attempted murder--made clear just how needed protection page s2878 supreme court security legislation question passed senate unanimously weeks ago but has faced inexplicable delays house representatives this should not partisan issue senate democratic whip said just yesterday house should pass this legislation really thought yesterday's arrest individual bent assassinating supreme court justice would have forced house democrats abandon political gains provide this urgently needed protection there excuse for further delay one press report suggests democrats may rethinking their opposition hope true house democrats should abandon political games today pass this legislation student loans madam president recent reporting suggests president biden may contemplating forgiving 10,000 federal student loan debt per borrower bad idea for many reasons difficult really know where start but let begin pointing out obvious forgiving 10,000 federal student loan debt will absolutely nothing address underlying problem fact would likely make things much worse price higher education has risen stratospherically recent decades cost year attendance some colleges--just year--is more than many americans yearly salaries problem but forgiving 10,000 student loan debt would absolutely nothing fix problem soaring tuition costs said would very likely make things worse what incentive would colleges have rein costs could confident part their students bill would eventually picked federal government because course one should deceived into thinking student loan forgiveness would one time thing one estimate suggests student loan burden this country would return its current amount within years--4 years--of 10,000 debt being forgiven calls forgive more debt would undoubtedly come much sooner future graduates are very likely want same deal would offered graduates today--the wiping away 10,000 debt--which brings another problem some students opting take unrealistic levels debt finance their educations how much greater problem going students think government likely step forgive some debt have agreed repay very easy imagine student feeling free take more debt than otherwise would believing government likely reduce resulting debt burden another massive problem with president biden's plan course its complete unfairness under president biden's plan individual who just finished paying his her student loans after years work would not receive penny meanwhile student who graduated month ago hasn't yet paid dime his her loans could see substantial part his her debt wiped away president's plan also incredibly unfair tens millions americans without any student loan debt who would asked subsidize student loan debt small percentage americans somewhere around two-thirds millennials have student debt either because didn't attend college didn't take out any loans attend college president's plan unfair those who avoided loans working their way through school choosing lower-cost college option unfair parents who worked for years ensure could finance their kids education unfair those who chose not attend traditional 4-year college instead trained one many essential trades depend from plumbing air conditioning broadband installation significantly lower-cost community college technical school another problem with president's plan what would teach about sanctity contracts while may times ill advised students freely enter into agreements when take out loan should really teaching agreements contracts mean nothing people can incur debt then not have pay off another important point make here average debt for undergraduate education this country not crippling might portrayed now there question there are students out there who were encouraged take unrealistic levels debt are currently struggling with huge debt burdens made private well federal loans but average debt average debt for undergraduate education somewhere around 29,000 not chump change for sure but also not unmanageable level debt for average college graduate--especially with availability extended repayment plans income-driven repayment programs average student loan debt rises substantially for those with advanced degrees there are certainly those who take far too much debt for graduate education but also important know those with advanced degrees have higher--and some cases much higher earning potential doctors for example take medical debt north 190,000 average but once have completed their education training can expect make robust--sometimes very robust--six figures per year making repaying debt size very feasible proposition there question cost higher education out control students sometimes take unrealistic levels debt pay for but forgiving student loan debt not answer for reasons have mentioned among others instead should exploring ways drive down education costs should also highlighting affordable education options like our nation's community colleges technical schools these institutions like outstanding tech schools have south dakota provide students with associate's degrees certificates apprenticeships opportunities learn trade more there are also things can help students pay off loans without forcing taxpayers shoulder burden december congress passed 5-year version legislation introduced with senator warner allow employers help employees repay their loans our employer participation repayment act amends educational assistance program permit employers make tax-free payments their employees student loans for employees who get help paying off their student loans for employers who have new option for attracting retaining talented workers our bill isn't cure-all but will certainly help ease pain paying back student loans for number americans pleased was enacted into law for 5-year period hope some point congress will act make permanent another big thing can course make sure graduates have access good-paying jobs this key enabling people pay off their debt should resolve build economic progress had made prepandemic focus policies will allow our economy thrive republicans are not alone thinking forgiving 10,000 student loan debt fraught with problems one democrat senator said across-the-board cancellation college debt does nothing address absurd cost college fix our broken student loan program offers nothing americans who paid off their college debts those who chose lower priced college way avoiding going into debt taking debt r]really importantly ignores majority americans who never went college some whom have debts just staggering from one our democrat colleagues here senate new york times editorial board not exactly known for toeing republican line noted canceling this debt even limited amounts white house considering would set bad precedent nothing change fact future students will graduate with yet more debt--along with blind hope another future amnesty such move legally dubious economically unsound politically fraught educationally problematic was from new york times editorial board page s2879 with inflation near 40-year high with president's approval rating hitting new low with democrats prospects for november looking less rosy not exactly surprising president would look toward student loan forgiveness way distracting voters some democrats are reportedly pushing for student loan forgiveness way boost their chances november but very much hope president will decide temporary political gain not good reason put american taxpayers hook for billions dollars student loan debt not their own new york times noted president's plan legally dubious economically unsound politically fraught educationally problematic strongly strongly encourage president abandon plan even democratic speaker house has suggested doesn't have authority implement yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer booker clerk will call roll senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded call roll durbin president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded

insurrectionist mob january proposal was made--and was legitimate thoughtful good faith proposal--to establish bipartisan commission get bottom it--who was behind it?--and ask hard questions what role did president donald trump play what unfolded after his rally january 2021 some people don't even want raise question let alone hear answer history demands truth unless have reached point saw times

will for many years come may disagree with her virtually every other issue but have respect for her courage serving this bipartisan committee federal bureau prisons president another topic secret federal bureau prisons has been plagued misconduct one investigation after another has revealed culture abuse mismanagement corruption torture death reaches all way top one most troubling investigations was published last week national public radio marshall project title report reads how newest federal prison became one deadliest facility question know well u.s penitentiary thomson located home state illinois fact facility officially originally encouraged federal government purchase order reduce overcrowding high security prisons opening u.s penitentiary thomson was supposed improve safety within bureau prisons but reality sadly has been exact opposite according this report seven inmates u.s penitentiary thomson have died just years five them were reportedly murdered other inmates two died suicide those deaths are just snapshot grim reality this facility--the deadly grim reality investigation paints picture rampant abuse prison staff this alleged abuse includes excessive use two kinds painful restraints--ambulatory restraints four-point restraints four refers each person's limbs which under this technique are chained concrete bed rendering individual immobile this american penitentiary bureau prisons protocol says page s2880 these restraints should used sparingly only momentarily--momentarily--restrain inmate who presents active danger himself others according this report some guards u.s penitentiary thomson have apparently made habit regularly using these restraints inmates--not momentarily but regularly some cases inmates have reportedly been left chained for hours days lawyer who has spoken with u.s penitentiary thomson inmates said inmates are denied food are denied water many them report being left their own waste it's really akin torture chamber this american prison state use restraints shackles has become common inmates have coined term describe scars leave their arms legs known thomson tattoo report also alleges staff u.s penitentiary thomson have gained reputation for stoking tensions between cellmates make mistake this special management unit these are inmates who can very dangerous understand understood when penitentiary was opened one example was highlighted this report indicative challenge was murder matthew phillips u.s penitentiary thomson inmate who died phillips was jewish man with visible star david tattoo corrections officers u.s penitentiary thomson reportedly locked phillips recreation cage with two known white supremacists these inmates beat phillips until was unconscious died from his injuries days later both men have since been indicted justice department murder hate crime charges following publication this shocking report joined senator duckworth colleague from illinois illinois congresswoman cheri bustos sending letter justice department's inspector general michael horowitz urged him launch full-scale immediate investigation into failures thomson prison spoke with general horowitz yesterday confirmed his office investigating deaths thomson along with many other abuses bureau prisons but this report about u.s penitentiary thomson only most recent look into house horrors bureau prisons federal bureau prisons already have ample evidence pattern neglect abuse has been embedded their bureaucracy consider for instance bureau's overuse restricted housing practice separating inmates from general prison population isolating them alone with one other person for hours time practice can cause severe mental anguish for inmates can severely harm prospects for ever reentering society much like use four-point restraints restricted housing should justice department noted 2016 used rarely applied fairly subjected reasonable constraints standard published standard bureau prisons during obama administration held two hearings which are still fresh mind were gripping issue solitary confinement following those hearings justice department took steps reduce reform bureau prisons use restricted housing started make real progress unfortunately progress was erased during trump administration since former president left office biden department justice has had plenty time change course leadership have urged them year half into this administration nearly percent bop inmates are still being held restricted housing same level was under president trump just plain unacceptable continued overuse restricted housing alleged abuses thomson are among many instances misconduct mismanagement have occurred under failed leadership bureau prisons director michael carvajal light those earlier reports detailing similar failures called for carvajal's resignation last november was welcome news when about weeks after asked for his resignation announced carvajal said was going resign but was january now are june justice department has shown little progress urgency naming carvajal's replacement result still running mismanaging bureau prisons this recent investigation thomson makes clear there are excuses for further delay today calling president biden attorney general garland deputy attorney general monaco one two things either name new reform-minded director replace carvajal immediately appoint acting director until permanent selection made this cannot wait need act before another inmate dies custody care this federal government coming weeks senate judiciary committee which chair will holding hearing bureau prisons will examine these allegations abuse thomson other facilities need answers from biden administration failure reduce use restricted housing will discuss what bop must address staffing crisis has contributed this disastrous situation crisis demands attention highest ranking officials within department justice has been long overdue time for have competent principled leadership bureau prisons not condemning every person who works agency for sure have met many them respect them but those who are guilty this misconduct need held accountable new leadership imperative has been long time since have had kind competent principled leadership believe attorney general garland deputy attorney general monaco will choose right leader clear out bureaucratic rot improve with significant reforms but need act quickly lives are stake yield floor presiding officer senator from texas gun violence cornyn president over last couple weeks many have spent lot time thinking about horrific shootings uvalde philadelphia buffalo elsewhere unfortunately these are familiar scenes have seen before would like try find way reduce likelihood their reoccurrence future there anything can here senate make possible have been working particularly with senator murphy who was partner fix nics bill passed 2018 senator murphy comes from blue state connecticut come from red state texas yet example were able take horrible events sutherland springs where innocent parishioners were gunned down small baptist church outside san antonio take out tragedy something good which bill call fix nics national instant criminal background check system since was signed into law 11\1/2 million new records have been uploaded into background check system believe has saved lives will recall case shooter was veteran u.s air force but unfortunately had troubled history felony convictions domestic violence mental health adjudications none was background check system should have been would have disqualified him had been known but did what often happens lied then bought--the lie buy--and tragedy ensued were all sickened these shootings are hyperaware public interest most common refrain hear something something unfortunately gets little less specific after what exactly should done where hard work begins but before optimistic can find something protects rights law-abiding citizens under our constitution under second amendment who believe are not page s2881 threat public safety focus people with criminal records people with mental health challenges like young salvador ramos uvalde like adam lanza sandy hook profile pretty well established--young alienated disaffected mentally challenged boys who lack access treatment which will help them manage their mental illness who descend into pit despair ultimately resulting their desire not only harm themselves but take other people with them profile well established scientific literature new york times did excellent piece couple weeks ago profile think gives little bit roadmap for sorts things might deal with what makes this more challenging than for example fix nics bill after sutherland springs was singular point failure here see multiple points failure think need address many can mentioned mental health issue looms large know during years where many students were isolated home trying keep with their studies virtually many them have languished many them have fallen behind because have been isolated from their peers time when their social development most important many them have fallen into despair exacerbating underlying problems may have first place trying figure out how support our schools our communities with resources needed address mental emotional health people who are struggling particularly young students seems like obvious area can work together obviously school security important initial reports uvalde were door was propped open salvador ramos entered later found out wasn't propped open but lock didn't work just walked right there are lot studies best practices when comes what necessary secure our schools can secure our airports post 9/11 can secure our schools make sure people who should come out those schools can relatively easily but outsiders cannot particularly those who are threat safety those students think all want try find ways reduce likelihood something like this happening again school districts across country are eager get our help guidance harden their infrastructure provide for personnel resource officers--that local police officer school campus those are things think would diminish likelihood another uvalde mental health school safety seem kind no-brainers sense where don't think there lot division between side aisle this side aisle but are also looking ways keep guns out hands people who already law are prohibited from having them not talking necessarily about expanding background check system want make sure background check system works what makes this challenging salvador ramos showed after his 18th birthday were born yesterday for purposes background check system there was insight into his many mental health challenges terroristic threats fellow students potentially drug use other things were adult could not pass background check but because fact juvenile records are typically sealed are not part nics review merchant who sold him firearms used didn't know anything about his track record but know how said earlier fits familiar profile shot his own grandmother because wanted him back school after being out school for last years engaged self mutilation self-cutting tortured animals made threats against his fellow students threatened sexual assault against his fellow female students made threats would fact what ultimately did online was ticking timebomb there some way for look back into sorts records would disqualify adult had occurred post-18--because would have been public records available national instant criminal background check system--if there way look back identify people like salvador ramos who virtue his mental health other problems would know should not able purchase firearm legally couple states--i think south carolina virginia voluntarily upload mental health adjudications for 17-year-olds can't compel other states but can sure provide--we can facilitate other states doing incentivize their populating nics background check system with this necessary information for juveniles who ultimately will end up--they will turn age able buy firearm need know ahead time for purposes background check system what those records look like there are number things could one suggestion for example take look background check process itself for 21-year-olds particular since population are focusing based this profile under current law buy firearm have clean record can pass your background check pretty quickly percent cases actually what happens average processing time minutes most cases system returns binary result either pass don't pass fail when fail means can't purchase firearm now congress senate--in particular senator coons from delaware sponsored bill would notify local police when somebody goes take background check fails because don't qualify many times local law enforcement knows more about these people would interested know tried illegally purchase firearm were denied but about percent gun purchases background check not resolved immediately system returns yellow light which means additional review required for example have common name like john smith search may pull records for somebody else for wrong person with same name who prohibited from purchasing gun could also caused incomplete criminal history--for example somebody convicted assault but further examination find out was domestic violence which prohibited category would also learn whether was felony misdemeanor those cases fbi under current law already has days which complete background check problem under current law there are finish--the seller still sells gun have incomplete record dylann roof believe was name shooter mother emanuel church charleston turned out had misdemeanor drug offense was not uploaded into background check system now disqualifying condition are addicted frequent user illegal drugs but because background check system did not allow enough time include information--maybe just maybe would have been denied purchase firearms ultimately used kill those innocent people day what are looking possibility of--in those cases where there what will call yellow flag indication further review necessary--an extended period time for this class purchasers between for background check system complete their review well have said before will say again don't believe law-abiding mentally well gun owners are going commit mass shootings are threat public safety know within senate have number people who are sportsmen who enjoy target shooting let's say who believe need exercise their second amendment rights order protect their family their homes are not threat blanket limitations prohibitions those law-abiding citizens who are not threat public safety never will strikes overreach are not talking about discretionary right are talking about page s2882 constitutional right but believe second amendment sound public policy are not mutually exclusive here needle are trying thread here adding juvenile records nics system commonsense way ensure have complete picture buyer's history then course there scandal our mental health delivery system united states today back sixties when people who had mental health challenges were institutionalized finally figured out didn't work very well was inhumane theory was there would created some safety net communities across country where people could turn where police answered 9-1-1 call realized this isn't criminal this somebody going through mental health crisis--where police could take people where could actually get help get treated get counseling get better doesn't exist today many communities--in major cities perhaps even suburban areas but uvalde population 15,000 not much are looking ways expand community-based mental health system senator stabenow senator blunt have great proposal would extend current eight-state pilot program nationwide now solely related what happened uvalde what happened buffalo what happened philadelphia but would address larger underlying challenge more more americans falling through cracks while know most people mental health crisis are not going commit acts violence also know percent gun related deaths are suicides occurred like light went off head salvador ramos adam lanza others this profile young men addition multiple homicides commit commit suicide know are not going make out alive addressing this mental health crisis affects our country particularly where fail these young men who feel like have nowhere else turn who become increasingly isolated become increasingly desensitized idea taking someone's life because are sitting their room playing video games killing people virtually all time then their bizarre fantasies decide extend those fantasies taking not only their own life but lives other innocent people this challenging president there doubt about but can this can this sometimes politics called art possible think this possible going perfect are going not have revisit some other scenario where people have fallen through cracks where vulnerabilities are exposed can't sure this one done but believe there sense urgency not only here congress but white house across country have all heard from our constituents who are anguish over what has happened uvalde elsewhere cry something like said not very specific understand but try find what right set policies would respect rights law-abiding citizens under constitution but same time address what know huge mental health crisis this country make sure systems are place work like national instant criminal background check system need populate system with relevant information would disqualify somebody were adult occurred while were juvenile there are ways can can incentivize can take look back some cases can allow national instant criminal background check system those limited

realization extreme ideology tragic error supreme court view court has done what has never done before expressly take away constitutional right fundamental many americans had already been recognized court's decision will have real immediate consequences state laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today jeopardizing health millions women some without exceptions extreme women could punished for protecting their health extreme women girls who are forced bear their rapist's childof child consequence it's ait just stuns extreme doctors will criminalized for fulfilling their duty

will senator yield question hawley what has president zelenskyy been asking for for weeks indeed months end said send planes what has this administration done actually first said yes then said maybe then said today secretary defense testified before armed services committee under oath even though this congress has appropriated billion military lethal aid people ukraine defense department has far given them less than one-third why because logistics was asked because policy his comment was are giving them what think need would just point out not what ukrainians think listen president zelenskyy listen ukrainian parliamentarians who have been here talked them what will say need more military aid need more help this administration won't give them not because logistics but because policy don't

forced change policy--his words change policy ukraine because fact had not been sharing all intelligence might have with ukrainian soldiers ukrainian military despite their request for whose decision was joe biden's his policy president hasn't been entirely silent did have this say for god's sake this man cannot remain power now joe biden doesn't appear know whether are fighting struggling help ukrainians defend themselves whether are launching war regime change russia itself know bottom line this one issue after another when comes ukraine this president has been wrong every aspect policy has mattered has been wrong any wonder ukrainians are saying change policies share your intelligence send aid have requested say again don't have logistics problem white house shouldn't point fingers shift blame have joe biden problem nub issue here there was joe biden's comment sounding like are going send ground troops you're going see when there said servicemembers some have been there you're going see--you're going see women young people standing front damn tank just saying i'm not leaving i'm holding ground president--it one gaffe after another one switch policy after another disaster from beginning end let's not forget where these foreign policy disasters really kicked off big way yeah was afghanistan concerned about afghanistan are darn right thirteen servicemembers were killed abbey gate including one from home state will never forget talking his father soon learned attack--before fact official notice his son's death had been released his father asked everything power hold this administration accountable exactly what going has anyone been held accountable yet for afghanistan has somebody been fired has somebody been relieved command has somebody been shown door has there been change policy department defense just stumble from one crisis another why because have joe biden problem this administration doing exactly what their commander chief wants them wrong again again again again until see some change policy from this administration until this senate gets serious about its oversight responsibilities department defense going ask for senior defense leaders least observe regular order can't block nomination can't halt but can ask regular order followed exactly what going ask with regard this nomination other senior leaders until there accountability until have change policy until this administration admits issue after issue virtually every aspect its foreign policy just dead wrong yield floor presiding officer senator from hawaii schatz what senator hawley wants excuse through his litany criticisms biden administration truth every senator has right without blocking logistics guy from department defense could have brought his floor charts out here given withering speech about all things thought went wrong but doing very specific thing damaging department defense have senior page s2071 dod leaders have armed services committee coming saying don't know what tell him don't know how satisfy him but blocking staffing senior leadership department defense this comes from guy who raised his fist solidarity with insurrectionists this comes from guy who before russian invasion suggested maybe would wise for zelenskyy make few concessions about ukraine their willingness join nato this comes from guy who just about month ago voted against ukraine aid saying going too slow voted voted ukraine aid now has gall say going too slow this final insult until--what--secretary austin resigns not serious request people used come during trump administration all time think trump should resign think tillerson should resign stupid course think all people disagree with should quit their jobs replaced with people love course think should all resign not how this world works not reasonable request from u.s senator until secretary defense quits his job going block all his nominees preposterous--and coming from person who exonerated donald trump for extorting zelenskyy for withholding lethal aid withheld lethal aid until--unless--zelenskyy would release false smears against joe biden's son then voted exonerate president trump for this spare new solidarity with ukrainians with free world because this man's record exactly opposite yield floor presiding officer senator from pennsylvania congressional record volume 168 number wednesday february 2022 senate pages s739-s747 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov unanimous consent request--executive calendar durbin madam president rise today speak about critical role played u.s attorneys u.s marshals keeping america safe law enforcement team effort need officials federal state local levels working together stop crime this country keep people safe their homes their neighborhoods was only months ago when came floor this senate request unanimous consent for senate take confirm five u.s attorney nominations despite outstanding credentials all these nominees one senator junior senator from arkansas refused allow senate confirm five nominees for u.s attorney positions voice vote--a tradition senate senator's objections had nothing with nominees said had nothing with their records had nothing with their qualifications well after was confronted floor senate lifted his objections were able get those u.s attorneys confirmed put them work there work done every state union make this safer nation believe law enforcement--we believe every level--and when there delay putting professionals place delay can cost lives stand say don't want defund police but then refuse fill vacancies when comes law enforcement inconsistent sadly find ourselves same position today months later with same senator from arkansas again objecting swift confirmation u.s attorney u.s marshal nominations short this same senator making increasingly difficult for prosecute violent criminals track down fugitives protect americans from gang violence cybercrime terrorism fraud worth taking moment consider what u.s attorneys u.s marshals positions hold are nearly old nation itself both u.s marshal u.s attorney positions were created judiciary act 1789 passed first congress signed into law president george washington specific responsibilities have changed over time but core function same this federal answer enforcing law prosecuting crimes protecting our communities u.s attorneys are charged with prosecuting all federal criminal offenses u.s marshals have responsibility risking their lives protect federal judges courthouses tracking down fugitives assisting locating recovering missing children just mention few short u.s attorneys u.s marshals play critical role enforcing law promoting public safety protecting our communities sad this same junior senator from arkansas blocking confirmations six u.s attorneys two u.s marshals today doing threatens public safety across america puts millions americans risk including most vulnerable despite all tough talk hear from many these senators other side aisle about their dedication law order keeping america safe republican senator who refuses take confirm these nominations expeditious way before ask for consent for senate confirm nominees would like yield majority leader schumer madam president thank majority whip thank for your good work chair judiciary for your talk this issue thank colleague from minnesota who has been passionate about getting this done well rise today join with democratic colleagues support these u.s attorneys marshals who have singlehandedly been delayed for weeks one senator junior senator from arkansas for decades--decades--democrats republicans have regularly cooperated swiftly confirm many many individuals selected each president serve their administration regardless party white house both sides have long agreed president deserves have his her administration place page s740 quickly doesn't mean don't disagree but does mean when nominees are held opposed blocked for legitimate purpose not for leverage partisan games score political points expense public safety most still believe principle but sadly not all other side aisle small group obstructionist republicans has spent last year hijacking rules senate place unprecedented number holds hundreds--hundreds--of presidential appointees let repeat this isn't about few nominees here there are talking about hundreds nominees this case colleague from arkansas holding back six u.s attorneys two u.s marshals--vital roles preserving public safety level partisan obstruction new low for senate when president trump was office every single u.s attorney u.s marshal--every single one--was confirmed this chamber with unanimous consent yes had deep deep problems with trump department justice but never did demand rollcall vote just confirm nominees like these fact last time senate had hold rollcall vote--listen this--the last time senate had hold rollcall vote confirm u.s attorney was half century ago--nearly half century ago--in 1975 not hard see why u.s attorneys marshals aren't political positions their job literally keep americans safe are federal prosecutors are federal law enforcement republican colleagues other side truly care about public safety why are obstructing appointments individuals whose jobs would precisely maintain public safety first place alice wonderland logic now this isn't just about breaking precedent right now communities across country still don't have their u.s attorneys job because obstruction here senate districts georgia ohio nevada minnesota michigan illinois are all still waiting for u.s attorneys sadly families who live these communities shouldn't have pay price for what very small number republicans are doing here but sadly what happening textbook example why americans are frustrated with senate are frustrated with their government other hand want thank democratic colleagues for advocating behalf u.s attorneys marshals thank friend senator durbin chairman judiciary for speaking passionately thank senator klobuchar for coming floor speak thank senators rosen cortez masto duckworth brown who have also spoken one way another these nominees will confirmed senate republican obstructionists can try delay but cannot stop these individuals from ultimately going through holds these nominees are not dropped will filing cloture them will schedule votes advance them until job finished means more late nights then more late nights are coming means vote series with six seven eight votes row then what will most don't want down road don't have overwhelming majority democrats republicans want preserve decades precedent comity has enabled work together nominees let say for one last time delaying appointment u.s attorneys u.s marshals over cheap partisan games ultimately makes americans less safe weakens law enforcement urge republican colleague drop his obstruction else can explain his colleagues why have schedule dizzyingly large number rollcall votes just push these nominees through thank colleagues for their work yield senator durbin durbin thank majority leader would like just add there must those following debate who are wondering what basis for junior senator from arkansas opposing these eight nominees there must something wrong with them there must something their background doesn't add consider variety individuals who are being held junior senator from arkansas ryan buchanan georgia u.s attorney for northern district jason frierson nevada u.s attorney for district nevada andrew luger minnesota u.s attorney for district minnesota--and senator from minnesota will speak just moment--mark totten michigan u.s attorney for western district michigan marisa darden ohio u.s attorney for northern district ohio delia smith virgin islands u.s attorney for district virgin islands eddie frizell again minnesota u.s marshal for district minnesota ladon reynolds illinois u.s marshal for northern district illinois looked especially our own nominees very closely make sure were qualified take these federal positions several colleagues are going come floor today speak about nominees being held one senator rather than delving into records all eight nominees let just focus one illinois--chief ladon reynolds nominated serve u.s marshal for northern district chief reynolds has served people illinois for nearly years joined oak park police department 1994 rising steadily through ranks until his appointment 2019 chief addition his service oak park police department chief reynolds serves illinois law enforcement training standards board illinois commission discrimination hate crimes executive board illinois association chiefs police short chief reynolds eminently qualified serve u.s marshal for northern district illinois there simply valid basis delay his confirmation have yet hear senator from arkansas come forward with bill particulars why has decided single out people whom just mentioned deny them opportunity make communities safer across america time high crime need for coordinated effort every single level there absolutely valid explanation why these individuals are being withheld from their responsibilities these communities need have law enforcement taken seriously respected holding nominations for particular reason other than political issue may bother senator certainly reason for jeopardize safety innocent people living these communities who depend these federal law enforcement officials their job this point would like make unanimous consent request madam president ask unanimous consent senate proceed consideration following nominations bloc calendar 660 661 662 663 739 740 741 742 senate vote nominations bloc

has heard explanation for why objecting every department justice nominee moving forward fast-track basis false has heard explanation repeatedly may not like but has heard taking this stance behalf four brave u.s marshals who defended federal courthouse portland from leftwing street militias associated with blm movement antifa summer was part riots all across our country but portland these riots were particularly dangerous marshals were targeted with lasers blind them with ball bearings page s741 with fireworks there were efforts barricade them inside courthouse set fire burn them alive these marshals are heroes should celebrated anyone who says support law enforcement should defending these marshals not surprisingly leftwing activists leftwing organizations like aclu are coming defense leftwing street militia attacked these marshals tried burn down portland courthouse suing marshals frivolous grounds many these marshals are being defended department justice department justice's longstanding custom practice either provide representation for its law enforcement officers when are sued court there some conflict reimburse them pay their legal fees four marshals are not being defended though these four marshals are gs-11s gs-13s have been serving our country for lifetime many them are veterans veterans foreign wars face financial bankruptcy ruin because department justice won't represent them many cases won't even give them answer explain why representation was denied when learned this demanded answers department justice had answers colleagues think going just roll out red carpet for department justice nominees confirmed politically connected positions while gs-11s gs-13s are hung out dry have another thing coming now some may say well maybe there are investigations underway maybe these officers engaged misconduct don't know won't give answers but here what know all four them--all four--are currently unrestricted active duty--unrestricted active duty would add all four--all four--are special operations group for marshals service which means say are marshals who are most likely deployed nationwide put circumstances risk their lives call for them use violence include lethal violence now don't know circumstances led denial representation these four marshals why some them are being strung along but have assume--i have assume--that are unrestricted active duty special operations group marshals service merrick garland vanita gupta can't have any doubts about their fitness serve their actions for all those weeks portland when defended courthouse from leftwing street militias understand colleagues want get their u.s attorneys their u.s marshals confirmed maybe there are people main justice want get confirmed well very simple could today could hear from merrick garland vanita gupta will defend these four u.s marshals court could hear satisfactory answer why won't defend marshals court because were standing leftwing street militia because were taking stance defend federal property from antifa don't know can't get answer maybe democratic colleagues could get answer but think just going roll over allow senate fast-track nominees department when gs-11s gs-13s law enforcement officials are being hung dry--sorry these are people--and have talked them--who were worried about buying christmas gifts for their children last year because had pay legal fees who are worried about paying mortgage next month who are worried about sending their kids camp sorry your lawyers have wait for week two get confirmed u.s attorney's position worried about four heroes who defended federal property from leftwing street militias yes object presiding officer baldwin objection heard durbin madam president try follow logic will senator committed law enforcement committed u.s marshals won't let appoint people fill vacancies takes case portland where wrote letter department justice within last weeks asking for status their defense these individuals now knows all know before can take any action for anybody need confidentiality waiver privacy statement routine all our offices each one these individuals despite interest junior senator from arkansas has their own legal right determine whether not want waive any privacy can tell public discuss even with senator their plight how want address there also something called attorney-client privilege which senator sure aware too privilege which allows individual deny ordinary access information choose their decision complication situation ignored senator from arkansas valiantly standing for u.s marshals won't appoint believes are important give their lives their country--and many have--and yet won't let them stand behalf our communities wants answer his letter until gets answer his letter then are not going able put law enforcement place deal with crime this country can make all statements run all ads make all speeches floor about concern for safety our communities then junior senator from arkansas says want safe your community but can't have u.s attorney prosecute those would-be terrorists can't have u.s marshal for pursuit fugitives from justice can't have u.s marshal protect courthouse for men women who work there every day risk their lives for administration justice this upside down are talking about individuals department justice has said are going defend them one question assume whether was acting scope his employment three are under review for reason this senator has decided stop administration justice these jurisdictions least slow down makes sense whatsoever basis for objecting these individuals has nothing with their individual qualifications didn't raise single question all said your lawyers are going have wait these were just lawyers waiting for fee these are men women willing serve serves public service more than just lawyers--not there anything wrong with category americans--but individuals who are willing engage public service why are such hurry are second year this president's administration time fill these vacancies senator schumer said earlier floor there are several republican side who just want drag this out interminably hopes can stop biden administration from filling these vacancies colleague from arkansas asked whether doj representing federal law enforcement personnel who protected federal courthouse portland fox news headline about his letter said cotton places hold doj nominees after refusal defend marshals involved portland antifa riots here reality department justice often represents pays private counsel represent federal employees sued their individual capacity but there are some constraints have mentioned them for example regulations require department justice can only represent employees for actions within scope their employment for example protecting portland courthouse which clearly within scope department justice can only represent them doing would interest united states clearly would are defending against terrorists senator knows this know why knows because page s742 department justice responded his letter just didn't like response--it didn't far enough department said department justice strongly supports provision representation federal officers acting line duty department also told him represents has paid for private counsel represent these employees who have been sued connection with events portland while denying only single request for representation don't know facts denial don't know there has been privacy waiver signed don't know this individual said have attorney-client privilege don't have tell senator from arkansas anyone what circumstances are senator from arkansas now demanding know why department justice denied this one request for representation why still reviewing three others right--he blocking confirmation critical law enforcement officials across united states until gets answer likes doj has already explained cannot comment further--here what said--``in light significant confidentiality interests applicable privileges mentioned earlier privacy laws attorney-client privilege doj's regulations make clear communication about employee's requests for representation are protected attorney client privilege privacy act prevents doj from disclosing personnel record employee should let clear these privileges protect privacy very law enforcement personnel whose interests senator from arkansas claims represent republican colleagues frequently claim party law order but this matter others are ones playing politics with law enforcement because department justice will not snap senator's request violate standing federal laws because won't ignore violate those laws privacy attorney-client privilege prepared endanger communities law enforcement until gets his way have heard republican colleagues time again claiming biden administration democratic mayors big cities are responsible for violent crime claim increase violent crime has nothing with fact america awash guns reality increase violent crime started during last administration under president trump affecting communities led both republican democratic officials being driven gun violence fbi statistics show percent homicides were committed with guns chicago number higher ninety-three percent homicides last year chicago were committed gun face gun violence crisis judiciary committee held five hearings last year ways reduce going continue this year but are going address this crisis are going need senators from both parties show some courage admit gun violence america real problem also need republicans stop defending violent insurrection took place right this chamber january 2021 senator was present all were will never forget day long live five brave police officers their lives result what republican national committee its official policy position calls legitimate political discourse this nothing new last year congress passed american rescue plan--$350 billion for state local governments made sure funding was going hire good law enforcement officials invested community violence intervention not single republican senator approved there are areas where are working together bipartisan legislation hope will continue last year president biden signed three laws area hope republican colleagues will take lesson from today are going stand together then let all stand behind federal law enforcement team when president trump asked for his team democrats senate cooperated gave those people him weren't people would have chosen but was president had right his best protect this nation does president biden president biden has called for significant increases for our police byrne justice program cops hiring program but this important funding has been delayed debate over appropriations shouldn't delay appointment these key law enforcement officials either again again democrats are working support law enforcement keep americans safe sometimes are joined these efforts republicans other times not but there benefit law enforcement when senators block confirmation well-qualified u.s attorney u.s marshal nominees see today urge senator from arkansas stand for law enforcement political story fox not worth undermining lives innocent americans have end this obstruction let these nominees protect serve now yield senator klobuchar presiding officer junior senator from arkansas cotton madam president surprised hear senator from illinois continue refer this political issue political story when have career law enforcement officers who put their lives line defend federal property from leftwing street militias are worried can put food table for their children can buy them gifts christmas can put braces them can send them summer camp don't consider political issue consider standing for law enforcement--not just these four but every deputy marshal around country who forms backbone marshals service backbone marshals service all across country who have wonder maybe are going next one hung out dry department justice confront rioter with wrong politics this not political issue now senator from illinois continues speak about confidentiality attorney-client privilege this all information has been communicated these four marshals just don't want share with here senate not case three them would say haven't heard anything lawsuit almost months old have been told nothing yet why have had out retain their own counsel one them was denied representation with more basis than saying not interest united states america well forgive don't trust vanita gupta determine what interest united states when comes defending law enforcement these marshals are told these determinations are final there appeal there recourse well recourse now senator from illinois keeps talking about these urgent law enforcement needs his own state illinois would point out position empty has been empty since 2018 was urgent senator from illinois could have cooperated with trump administration tried fill then these u.s attorney positions are empty--president biden fired all u.s attorneys year ago was urgent have senate-confirmed u.s attorneys position could have asked them continue serve until was able find suitable replacements senator from illinois also said well senator cotton got his letter responded not looking for some courtesy exchange letters here trying protect four u.s marshals who defended portland courthouse from leftwing street militia who have been hung out dry imperiling confidence all marshals across country whether not their political leadership department justice will back them when are controversy department still won't answer won't page s743 take any steps answer simply hide behind confidentiality privilege just like are hiding behind with these four u.s marshals--after months what complicated senator from illinois said are representing others what makes these four different maybe engaged misconduct possible given fact are all unrestricted active duty special operations group element marshals most likely have use violence include lethal violence would merrick garland vanita gupta really send them back out streets had engaged misconduct portland these marshals deserve better could get better department justice would just agree represent them would give satisfactory fact-based answer about why are not representing them maybe some democratic colleagues could call merrick garland vanita gupta ask them for such answer maybe just call them say why don't represent these four marshals seems like obvious satisfactory outcome for everyone here u.s marshals are represented court should can back fast-tracking department justice nominees but until get outcome won't fast-tracking department nominees because will continue stand for these brave men law enforcement who deserve better from this department justice presiding officer senior senator from

toledo cleveland akron canton youngstown mansfield warren--cities basically northern half state u.s attorney has highest caseload last years filing record 846 indictments 2021 alone without full-time

confirming u.s marshals whether confirming u.s attorneys thankfully have extremely qualified nominee ohio who ready eager serve only thing standing our way u.s senate apparently only thing standing senate's way senator cotton although sure somebody else would willing take his place marissa darden seasoned prosecutor with extensive experience lead attorney both civil criminal cases assistant u.s attorney northern district was recognized for her work several cases involving highly complex legal issues received national high intensity drug trafficking areas award for outstanding opioid investigation effort 2016 for outstanding investigative effort 2019 listen what some people have said federal district court judge benita pearson can assured darden will fiercely enforce law while treating all--attorneys staff accused community--with respect appropriate sensitivity former acting u.s attorney justin herdman nominated president trump supported senator portman both--u.s attorney justin herdman was last confirmed u.s attorney northern district described her attorney outstanding ability unquestioned integrity said leader who has proven track record delivering results inside

her belief darden possesses intellect vision temperament judgment needed lead u.s attorney's office during this perilous season dea special agent charge keith martin with years experience one best has ever encountered said explained was phenomenal her interaction with law enforcement cooperative stands her principles can't imagine better choice these qualifications--i repeat senator portman also supports darden's nomination her confirmation would also historic making her first african-american woman ever serve u.s attorney ohio unfortunately senator cotton blocks this nomination addition these eight other law enforcement nominees his own admission his objections these nominees have nothing with their qualifications support his desire get answers from doj should get them but solution for his disagreement with doj not with million ohio citizens who pay price millions citizens illinois nevada who pay price minnesota anywhere last thing will say last week spoke with police officers

president's comments correspondents dinner other night may have taken year but finally president white house are starting realize have american people when comes their agenda think because can only betray someone many times before stop giving 2nd chance 3rd chance even 15th chance doing something after months alternating between anger confusion fear all tennesseans can just have laugh what white house saying how are trying spin what actually happening how are trying tell what are seeing really not what are seeing know--the american people know tennesseans know--that much what hear coming out this administration coupled with threat coupled with falsehood sometimes even coupled with mandate joe biden has what little control had but rather than reexamining his priorities has decided cause much pain can before democrats power this pattern biden administration doesn't lead mandate don't come congress say let's this throw out executive order then when those mandates orders are tossing out like are candy backfire come about this trying inflict much pain can when business owners pushed back pandemic mandates made their survival impossible this administration didn't relent doubled down just accused everybody who disagreed with them being danger their communities all heard stories are putting profit over people don't care about their communities just want keep doors open but no--what wanted was serve their communities when parents asked questions about what their kids were learning school justice department threatened throw them jail protested curriculum influenced critical race theory other radical ideologies when administration saw their climate panic message wasn't resonating anymore came out with plan double down again take away few transportation energy options people could still afford their response historic levels inflation tax spend american people into submission see this way are parent show ask questions about what are seeing your child study then want report say are one who causing problem isn't amazing how this administration has allowed cancel culture infiltrate everything their way highway would say tennessee because plan run over plan cause pain this not governing punishment--punishment for your beliefs punishment for your actions punishment for standing for constitution for democracy for freedom speech are going punish now thought administration had hit rock bottom with their response recordbreaking inflation created but their plan address joe biden's border crisis has been what has taken cake foolish dangerous situation along our southern border bad getting worse just this weekend spent some time out west tennessee was over benton county which northwest corner state talked with sheriff kenny christopher told his officers are finding fentanyl about percent drugs seize everything laced with fentanyl this marijuana heroin gummy bears--everything fentanyl loose running wild between 2021 64,000 people this country died from fentanyl overdoses 2,014 them were tennesseans where this coming from coming right across southern border important note this problem escalated after joe biden became president cartels knew with border patrol donald trump had its back but now with joe biden running wide open every town border town every state border state are losing control over flow drugs cartels are control southern border don't come across without them nothing comes across without them are emboldened every law enforcement officer meet with can tell what cartel hub--that right cartel hub--here this country u.s soil setting their drug trafficking human trafficking sex trafficking operations control border march cbp recorded more than 220,000 encounters with people trying illegally enter country fortunately were able use title expel about 100,000 those 220,000 individuals title has been lifesaver for border patrol don't believe ask them will tell lifesaver have used more than million times deny entry ease strain their limited resources need need title will tell need title course biden administration getting ready take title away let's just open border endangering our sovereignty endangering our people every town border town every state border state but let's throw caution wind open border come one come all had 160 different countries come across border last year let's see can break record this year--that what this white house saying total disregard for american people because take away title are going see not 6,000 illegal entries day are going see 18,000 illegal entries day know this what will happen have plan don't have plan are expecting 18,000 people day works out over half million month--a half million month now know secretary mayorkas admitted last week his hearing just didn't seem have plan but was expecting this happen tennessee have 345 cities towns villages--345 out those 345 cities towns percent those towns have population 20,000 less equivalent population typical tennessee town coming across southern border every day how long can sustain your state illinois madam president all have about 1,200 towns cities are incorporated have got 102 counties out those 1,299 incorporated towns cities percent those likewise are 20,000 less population had half million month equal naperville aurora rockford together how long could illinois sustain see this policy not only affects border with united states mexico those towns communities counties every county this country when mayorkas was speaking last week over house what didn't was confirm administration has plan reduce illegal immigration indeed care all about page s2239 securing border imagine secretary department homeland security who does not believe secure border cannot make this stuff can't make for weeks now bipartisan group senators has pressed department homeland security for their plan secure border secure this country for weeks have ignored our concerns today chairman durbin has plan summon secretary mayorkas for hearing can ask him directly last week however things escalated during hearing house appropriations committee when secretary confirmed administration considering pulling staff resources out va-run facilities sending them border this crazy not part department veterans affairs fourth mission help biden administration save face but even was already struggling serve veterans are veterans affairs committee our case backlog for benefits for healthcare over 260,000 cases are going take resources medical personnel administrative personnel what with them send them border getting basic care through has become almost impossible hear hear all hear from our veterans know these facilities are understaffed this why are wanting community care agency experiencing 15-year high turnover for nurses what does this administration say are going take people left working healthcare administration are going shift them down border because border patrol needs some help meanwhile people who have put uniform have fought for this nation can't get healthcare this administration acts like don't give ripping flip about any veterans our nation's sovereignty securing border protecting our citizens eliminating impact drugs are flooding our streets make our veterans suffer unconscionable administration knows border encounters have consistently increased since day took power--they know this have watched it--and appears have intentionally purposefully allowed know long border open people from all around globe are going come said 160 different countries last year known terrorist watch list individuals--42 them but rather than keeping title place embracing remain mexico building wall giving border patrol resources have asked for years defend this border this administration has decided way about this let veterans suffer have waited months months year can wait little longer their thought take resources out send border there nothing compassionate about this narrative there nothing caring there nothing right about this narrative know reason that--as president said knows his approval rating low knows there reason for not doing anything about choosing not anything about choosing not shift his priorities will tell have spent lot adult life greatest creative community face earth are surrounded some writers storytellers would say for some great authors storytellers neighborhood couldn't mash together plotline convoluted this one because people would say would never happen united states would never see purposefully running inflation running cost energy opening our southern border allowing terrorists drug dealers sex traffickers human traffickers gangs run would never knowingly allow cartels set shop u.s soil wouldn't but this administration has did because know pain

between his last tweet 1:49 2:24 his staff repeatedly came into room see him plead make strong public statement condemning violence instructing mob leave capitol did not relent until after o'clock when went out rose garden film his now infamous home message pat cipollone was top white house lawyer here what told about his reaction seeing violence his advice throughout afternoon heaphy when did first realize there was actual violence rioting cipollone i--i first realized may have been television may have been tony may have been philbin but found out people were--you know weren't capitol yet but were know--and then started watching know then was aware heaphy what specifically did think needed done cipollone think was pretty clear there needed immediate forceful response statement--public statement people need leave capitol now heaphy question exactly sounds like from very onset violence capitol right around o'clock were pushing for strong statement people should leave capitol right cipollone was others were well vice chair cheney pat you--you said expressed your opinion forcefully could tell exactly how did cipollone yeah can't--i don't have--you know have to--on privilege issue can't talk about conversations with president but can generically say said know people need told--there needs public announcement fast need leave capitol vice chair cheney pat could let know approximately when said cipollone approximately when almost immediately after found out people were getting into capitol approaching capitol way was--was violent heaphy remember any discussion with mark meadows with respect his view president didn't want do--was somehow resistant wanting say something along lines suggested cipollone tony inaudible]--just clear many people suggested not just many people felt same way i'm sure had conversations with mark about this during course day expressed my--my opinion very forcefully this needs done heaphy your advice was tell people leave capitol took over hours when there were subsequent statements made tweets put forth your view were insufficient did continue cipollone throughout period time until 4:17 continue others push for stronger statement cipollone yes heaphy were joined effort ivanka trump cipollone yes heaphy eric herschmann cipollone yes heaphy mark meadows cipollone yes hutchinson white house counsel's office wanted there strong statement out condemn rioters i'm confident i'm confident ivanka trump wanted there strong statement condemn rioters don't know private conversation had with trump but remember when came office one time with white house counsel's office--when came chief staff's office with white house counsel's office was talking about speech later day trying get her dad board with saying something was more direct than had wanted time throughout afternoon cipollone think mark also wanted--got--i remember him getting ivanka involved because--said get ivanka down here because thought would important don't think jared was there morning but think came later remember thinking was important get him there too and--and course pat philbin know was expressing same things mean pat philbin know was very--as said don't think there was one these meetings where--there might have been but for most part remember both going down together going back getting phone calls was also very clearly expressing this view kinzinger pat cipollone cassidy hutchinson aide chief staff mark meadows also told about hang mike pence chants will see cipollone recalled conversations about those chants west wing but relied executive privilege maintain confidentiality over his others direct communications with president although cipollone was unwilling provide more detail hutchinson provided more explicit information filling those blanks see for yourself hutchinson wasn't until mark hung phone handed back went back desk couple minutes later him pat came back possibly eric herschmann too i'm pretty sure eric herschmann was there but i'm--i'm confident was pat was there remember pat saying something effect mark need something more they're literally calling for vice president f'ing hung mark had responded something effect heard him pat thinks mike deserves doesn't think they're doing anything wrong which pat said something this f'ing crazy need doing something more briefly stepped into mark's office heaphy remember any discussion any point during day about rioters capitol chanting hang mike pence cipollone yes remember--i remember hearing that--about yes don't know observed myself heaphy i'm just curious understand the--the privilege line you've drawn but remember what can share with about discussion about those chants hang mike pence chants cipollone can tell view heaphy yes please cipollone view outrageous for anyone suggest such thing vice president united states for people crowd chanting thought was terrible thought was outrageous wrong expressed very clearly schiff with respect your conversations with meadows though did specifically raise your concern over vice president with him and--and how did respond cipollone believe raised concern about vice president i--and i--again nature his response without recalling exactly was he--you know people were doing all could schiff what about president did indicate whether thought president was doing what needed done protect vice president purpura privilege heaphy have assert question would crosstalk cipollone continuing i'm being instructed privilege heaphy see kinzinger addition cipollone testified would have been feasible commentators television were suggesting for president trump immediately appear podium press room address nation heaphy would have been possible any moment for president walk down podium briefing room tell talk nation any time between when first gave him advice o'clock 4:17 when video statement went would have been possible cipollone would have been possible heaphy yes cipollone yes would have been possible kinzinger just heard cipollone say president trump could have gone press briefing room issue statement any moment give sense just how easy would have been let's take look map west wing saw earlier president's private dining room bottom map press briefing room top highlighted blue rose garden where president ultimately his home video right next oval office highlighted green matthews how

told about colleague who said during attack president should not condemn violence can please tell about moment your reaction matthews yes conversation started press office after president sent out those two tweets deemed were insufficient colleague suggested president shouldn't condemn violence because thought would handing media were condemn his supporters disagreed thought should condemn violence condemn unequivocally thought needed include call action tell these people home debate ensued over became visibly frustrated colleagues were well aware couldn't believe were arguing over this middle west wing talking about politics tweet being concerned with handing media when had just watched all violence unfold capitol motioned said think looks like we're f'ing winning because don't

been said point for something camera wood what else think should have been said deere more forceful--a more forceful dismissal violence more forceful command home more forceful respect for law enforcement even comparison respect had given law enforcement relates what was done them prior summer thought was important acknowledgment given u.s capitol building itself what it's symbol what means not only people work there but american people generally work congress law needed conducted day wood wish hindsight president had asked protesters leave capitol earlier than ended asking them mcenany course would have loved home message would have happened earlier day mrs luria president's words matter know many rioters were listening president trump heard from one last week stephen ayres let's listen what had say about 4:17 message from president see how rioters reacted president's message real time ayres well when were there soon come out everybody started talking about that's--it seemed

our nation's history president trump was treating celebratory occasion with tweet just further cemented decision resign kinzinger others agreed with your assessment tweet let's look what had say george who asked about this tweet before was sent luna president george tell about conversation everything said said best your recollection luna sure said what think this believe saw text message the--on his phone i--i remember saying him wording first sentence--i guess it's one long sentence but wording first sentence would lead some believe potentially had something with events happened capitol george what did say luna don't recall him saying anything response believe was end conversation george did change anything light your comments luna sir did not george what about this made think someone might perceive president having role violence capitol luna it--it was interpretation words mean i'm i'm not a--you know don't write speeches anything but phrase these are things happen sounded if--as culpability was associated with murtaugh don't think it's patriotic act attack capitol but have idea how characterize people other than trespassed destroyed property assaulted u.s capitol think calling them patriots let's say stretch say least aganga-williams all stretch just flatly wrong murtaugh don't think it's patriotic act attack u.s capitol aganga-williams would call unpatriotic murtaugh criminal unpatriotic sure cipollone what happened capitol cannot justified any form fashion was wrong was tragic lot--and was terrible day was terrible day for this country jacob thought was inappropriate wood why jacob mind was day should remembered infamy wasn't tenor this tweet kinzinger despite violence day effort delay certification continued evening rudy giuliani called several president trump's closest political allies hour before joint session resumed representative jim jordan senators marsha blackburn tommy tuberville bill haggerty lindsey graham josh hawley ted cruz know why giuliani was calling them because 7:02 left voicemail for senator tuberville which later became public let's listen just start giuliani hello senator tuberville should say coach tuberville this rudy giuliani president's lawyer i'm calling because want discuss with how they're trying rush this hearing how need our republican friends try just slow down can get these legislatures get more information kinzinger giuliani did not even mention attack capitol instead was pushing behalf president trump get members congress further delay certification even though some members did proceed with objections vice president pence congress stood firm successfully concluded joint session early morning hours january 7th here some what members president's party said days weeks after attack senator mcconnell there's question none president trump practically morally responsible for provoking events day question about people who stormed this building believed were acting wishes instructions their president having belief was foreseeable consequence growing crescendo false statements conspiracy theories reckless hyperbole which defeated president kept shouting into largest megaphone planet earth mccarthy violence destruction chaos saw earlier was unacceptable undemocratic un-american was saddest day i've ever had serving member this institution roy madam speaker today people's house was attacked which attack republic itself there excuse for woman died people need jail president should never have spun certain americans believe something simply cannot kinzinger well after morning congress certified election results soon after this statement president trump was posted dan scavino's twitter account because president's account now had been suspended can see president trump stuck with his big lie election was stolen but did say there would orderly transition learned though statement was not necessarily his idea jason miller campaign adviser told after joint session started heard nothing from president trump white house about assuring nation transfer power would take place miller took upon himself draft statement called president 9:23 night convince him put out let's listen what had say about call heaphy did disagree with something had put statement some particular word phrase that--that did not want included jason miller i'd say just wanted say peaceful transition said ship's kind-of already sailed we're going say orderly transition was--that was about extent disagreement or--or pushback from conversation kinzinger last person president trump spoke phone night was johnny mcentee his head personnel mcentee told talked about events day multiple resignations administration officials decision whether resign was one weighed heavily people administration one hand people like pottinger matthews here proud were have served refused associated with president trump's dereliction duty but others were sincerely worried leaving president trump his own devices would put country continued risk listen what heard about tension from pat cipollone from general mark milley eugene scalia who was secretary labor cipollone then after some people were resigning obviously over january 6th know who they--they were did consider yes did cipollone concerned about people counsel's office left who would--who would replace had some concerns might somebody who know had been giving bad advice secretary scalia morning 7th decision arrived was most constructive thing could think was seek meeting cabinet know thought trying work within administration steady ship was likely have know greater value than simply resigning after which point would have been powerless really affect things with administration cipollone eugene thought there should cabinet meeting heaphy know why mark thought would not productive cipollone i--i--i don't remember why i--i think probably had something with mark's view how president might react he--you know but things like general milley there was couple calls where know meadows and/or pompeo but more meadows know how--how president doing like pompeo might say how's president doing meadows would say well he's really dark place like here's one for example 7th january this day after right potus very emotional bad place meadows kinzinger heard secretary scalia wanted president trump convene cabinet meeting put his request memo president here what said can see secretary scalia recommended president longer publicly question election results after wednesday one can deny this harmful secretary scalia also highlighted importance public knowing president would invoke his cabinet decision making not certain private individuals though secretary scalia did not say was referring rudy giuliani rest so-called clown car working with president trump try overturn election secretary scalia understood president needed more reassure public about last few weeks trump administration pottinger when made decision resign did walk out white house immediately pottinger wanted first talk immediate boss was national security advisor robert o'brien robert o'brien was traveling 6th reached him about 4:30 p.m told him was submitting resignation accepted resignation but also asked whether could stay until could get back white house agreed both wanted make sure was leaving responsible way still have foreign adversaries worry about know hackers terrorists nation-states did not want leave chair empty given was top national security staffer white house ended staying desk through night when robert o'brien arrived back white house next morning morning 7th debriefed with him left for last time kinzinger both share passion for national security our country can share with what your view how january 6th impacted our national security pottinger well when have presidential transition even under best circumstances it's time vulnerability it's time vulnerability for--when have contested election was certainly concerned some our adversaries would tempted probe test u.s resolve example late december iranian government attacked u.s embassy baghdad did using some their terrorist proxies president trump did handle sent very clear warning ayatollah his regime which think had useful effect think would have handled other threats nature luckily other threats materialized before inauguration 20th but our national security was harmed different way 6th january it--i think emboldened our enemies helping give them ammunition feed narrative our system government doesn't work united states decline china putin regime russia tehran they're fond pushing those kinds narratives way they're wrong know we've been hearing for entirety u.s history from kings despots united states decline those kings despots have been proven wrong every single time but nonetheless january 6th helped feed perception think emboldens our adversaries know other part think simply our allies heard from lot friends europe asia allies close friends supporters united states were concerned about health our democracy think it's incumbent upon put their minds ease put our own hearts ease investigating what happened 6th making sure never happens again kinzinger look i've always said democracies are not defined bad days they're defined how recover from those bad days that's what we're doing here bring accountability can actually come back even stronger than when went into january 6th matthews left white house for last time night january 6th what did think americans needed hear from president trump matthews think american people needed hear see him publicly commit peaceful least orderly transition power aftermath capitol attack wasn't just enough for ask him condemn violence needed agree would peacefully transfer power over incoming administration because that's one our fundamentals what means live democracy evening when resigned resignation statement drafted referenced this said our nation needs peaceful transfer power hopes would put some sort public pressure white house president trump publicly agree orderly transition kinzinger thank yield friend from virginia mrs luria thank kinzinger staff who remained white house morning january 7th knew president needed address nation again had speech prepared for him morning but refused for hours give heard cassidy hutchinson testify previously president trump finally agreed record address nation later evening evening january 7th because concerns might removed from power under 25th amendment impeachment know these threats were real sean hannity said himself text message day press secretary kayleigh mcenany wrote more stolen election talk yes impeachment 25th amendment are real obtained never-before-seen raw footage president recording his address nation day january 7th more than hours after last time had addressed nation from rose garden let's talk look white house staff whenever you're ready sir president trump would like begin addressing heinous attack yesterday president trump continuing those who broke law will pay not represent our movement not represent our country broke law--i can't say i'm not gonna--i already said will pay president trump demonstrators who infiltrated capitol have defied seat of--it's defiled right see can't see very well i'll this i'm going this let's president trump but this election now over congress has certified results don't want say election's over just want say congress has certified results without saying election's over okay trump but congress has--now congress has president trump yeah right trump now congress president trump didn't say over let--let see paragraph before president trump okay would like begin addressing heinous attack yesterday yesterday hard word for trump just take out say heinous attack white house staff say heinous attack our nation president trump good take word yesterday out because doesn't work heinous attack our country say our country want say trump keep president trump only goal was ensure integrity vote--my only goal was ensure integrity vote mrs luria january 7th day after incited insurrection based lie president trump still could not say election was over pottinger you've taken oath multiple times marines official executive branch can please share with your view about oath office how translates into accepting election results transfer power pottinger sure know this isn't first time we've had close election this country president trump certainly had every right challenge court results these various elections but once you've had due process under law have conform with law matter how bitter result once you've presented your evidence court judges have heard evidence judges have ruled continue contest election you're not just contesting election anymore you're actually challenging constitution itself are challenging societal norms allow remain unified think one example for example you've got vice president richard nixon back 1960 had hard-fought election against senator john kennedy there were irregularities vote according lot histories lot vice president nixon's supporters asked him fight contest don't concede but one his finest moments vice president nixon said said would tear country pieces conceded jack kennedy announced was going support him next president have example democratic candidate for president vice president gore who faced very similar dilemma strongly disagreed with supreme court decision his election bid allowed president george bush take office but gave speech concession late december mid late december 2000 where said this for sake unity people for strength our democracy also going concede i'm going support new president his speech actually pretty good model think for any candidate for any office including president from any party read particularly right now know oath our presidents take it's very similar oath office took u.s marine officer oath took white house official support defend constitution it's protect constitution bear truth faith allegiance constitution sacred oath it's oath take before our families take oath before god think have obligation live oath still believe have most ingenious system government earth despite its imperfections don't envy countries don't have this system actually allows for predictable peaceful transfer government every years it's not something should take for granted mrs luria thank heard start hearing immediate aftermath january 6th republican leader kevin mccarthy understood president trump bore responsibility for day should have taken immediate action stop violence was even more candid calls with republican colleagues you'll hear moment recordings some these calls were made were later published new york times context for these calls was resolution had been introduced house calling for vice president pence cabinet remove president trump from power under 25th amendment let's listen mccarthy i've had with this guy what did unacceptable nobody can defend nobody should defend mccarthy only discussions would have with him think this will pass would recommendation should resign mean would take but don't think would take but don't know mccarthy but let very clear all i've been very clear president bears responsibility for his words actions ifs ands buts asked him personally today does hold responsibility for what happened does feel bad about what happened told does have some responsibility for what happened he'd need acknowledge mrs luria president trump has never publicly acknowledged his responsibility for attack only time apparently did was private call with kevin mccarthy there's something else president trump has never acknowledged names memories officers who died following attack capitol we're honored joined tonight police first responders who bravely protected january 6th your character courage give hope democracy can should prevail even face violent insurrection this dais can never thank enough for what did protect our democracy january 9th two president trump's top campaign officials texted each other about president's glaring silence tragic death capitol police officer brian sicknick who succumbed his injuries night january 7th his campaign officials were tim murtaugh trump's director communication one his deputies matthew wolking their job was convince people vote for president trump knew his heart his mind his voice well anyone knew how connects with his supporters here's what had say about their boss murtaugh said also shitty not have acknowledged death capitol police officer wolking responded that's enraging everything said about supporting law enforcement was lie which murtaugh replied know what this course acknowledged dead cop he'd implicitly faulting mob won't because they're his people would also close acknowledging what he'd lit rally got out control way acknowledges something could ultimately called his fault way president trump did not then does not now have character courage say american people what his own people know true responsible for attack capitol january 6th thank yield gentleman from illinois kinzinger thank mrs luria tonight's testimony evidence sobering straightforward within minutes stepping off ellipse stage donald trump knew about violent attack capitol from comfort his dining room watched attack escalated sent tweets inflamed expressed support for desire some literally kill vice president mike pence for hours refused call off attack donald trump refused take urgent advice received day not from his political opponents from liberal media but from his own family his own friends his own staff his own advisers midst attack when there was time for politics people closest trump told him truth was his supporters attacking capitol alone could get through them pled for him act place his country above himself still refused lead meet moment honor his oath was only once vice president members congress were secure locations officers defending capitol began turn tide then-president trump engaged political theater telling mob home even then told them all were special loved them whatever your politics whatever think about outcome election americans must all agree this donald trump's conduct january 6th was supreme violation his oath office complete dereliction his duty our nation stain our history dishonor all those who have sacrificed died service our democracy when present our full findings will recommend changes laws policies guard against another january 6th reason that's imperative forces donald trump ignited day have not gone away militant intolerant ideologies militias alienation disaffection weird fantasies disinformation they're all still out there ready that's elephant room but january 6th has reminded anything pray has reminded this laws are just words paper mean nothing without public servants dedicated rule law who are held accountable public believes oaths matter more than party tribalism cheap thrill scoring political points people must demand more our politicians ourselves oaths matter character matters truth matters not renew our faith commitment these principles this great experiment ours our shining beacon hill will not endure yield gentlewoman from virginia mrs luria thank kinzinger throughout our hearings we've provided many facts painted vivid picture events january 6th violence human toll both emotional physical including tragic life threats our constitution rule law danger this nation nation all love americans tonight's hearing we've gone into great detail about events inside white house january 6th we've described how president united states who was bound oath constitution duty ensure laws are faithfully executed took action when cornerstone our democracy peaceful transition power was under attack but it's more than donald trump summoned violent mob promised lead mob capitol compel those thought would cave kind pressure when was thwarted his effort lead armed uprising instigated attackers target vice president with violence man who just wanted his constitutional duty end this not may appear story inaction time crisis but instead was final action donald trump's own plan usurp will american people remain power not until was clear his effort violently disrupt delay counting election results had failed did send his message--a message his supporters which commiserated with their pain told them affectionately home was not message condemnation just punishment for those who broke law expect from president whose oath duty ensure laws are faithfully executed but instead was his newest version stand back stand this personal first swore oath support defend constitution against enemies foreign domestic when entered u.s naval academy age spent two decades ships sea defending our nation from known identifiable foreign enemies who sought harm never imagined enemy would come from within was not prescient abraham lincoln who years before civil war said destruction our lot must ourselves its author its finisher donald trump was author people for ourselves our posterity should not let donald trump finisher thank yield vice chair vice

girls owe debt all those who have will appear here brings another point this committee has shown testimony dozens republican witnesses those who served president trump loyally for years case against donald trump these hearings not made witnesses who were his political enemies instead series confessions donald trump's own appointees his own friends his own campaign officials people who worked for him for years his own family have come forward have told american people truth for those who seem think evidence would different republican leader mccarthy had not withdrawn his nominees from this committee let ask this really think bill barr such delicate flower would wilt under cross-examination pat cipollone eric herschmann jeff rosen richard donoghue course aren't none our witnesses are one point 2016 when was first running for office donald trump said this could stand middle fifth avenue shoot somebody wouldn't any voters quote came mind last week when audio from trump adviser steve bannon surfaced from october just few days before presidential election let's listen bannon what trump's going declare victory right he's going declare victory but doesn't mean he's winner he's just gonna say he's winner bannon democrats--more our people vote early count theirs vote mail they're going have natural disadvantage trump's going take advantage--that's our strategy he's gonna declare himself winner when wake wednesday morning it's going firestorm bannon also--also trump is--if trump losing o'clock night it's going even crazier because he's gonna sit right there say stole biden's winning trump going some crazy shit vice chair cheney course days later president trump declared victory when his own campaign advisers told him had absolutely basis what new steve bannon audio demonstrates donald trump's plan falsely claim victory matter what facts actually were was premeditated perhaps worse donald trump believed could convince his voters buy whether had any actual evidence fraud not same thing continued occur from election day onward until january 6th donald trump was confident could convince his supporters election was stolen matter how many lawsuits scores them was told over over again immense detail election was not stolen there was evidence widespread fraud didn't matter donald trump was confident could persuade his supporters believe whatever said matter how outlandish ultimately could summoned washington help him remain president for another term showed last week even president trump's legal team led rudy giuliani knew had actual evidence demonstrate election was stolen again didn't matter here's worst part donald trump knows millions americans who supported him would stand defend our nation were threatened would put their lives their freedom stake protect her preying their patriotism preying their sense justice january 6th donald trump turned their love country into weapon against our capitol our constitution has purposely created false impression america threatened foreign force controlling voting machines wave tens millions false ballots were secretly ejected into our election system ballot workers have secret thumb drives are stealing elections with them all complete nonsense must remember cannot abandon truth remain free nation late november while president trump was still pursuing lawsuits many were urging him put any genuine evidence fraud forward courts accept outcome those cases january 6th approached circulated memo republican colleagues explaining why our congressional proceedings count electoral votes could not used change outcome election but what did not know time was president trump's own advisers also republicans also conservatives including his white house counsel his justice department his campaign officials were all telling him almost exactly same thing was telling colleagues there was evidence fraud irregularities sufficient change election outcome our courts had ruled was over now know didn't matter what any said because donald trump wasn't looking for right answer legally right answer factually was looking for way remain office let's put aside for moment focus just what saw today our hearing tonight saw american president faced with stark unmistakable choice between right wrong there was ambiguity nuance donald trump made purposeful choice violate his oath office ignore on-going violence against law enforcement threaten our constitutional order there way excuse behavior was indefensible every american must consider this can president who willing make choices donald trump made during violence january 6th ever trusted with any position authority our great nation again this room 1918 committee women's suffrage convened discuss debate whether women should granted right vote this room full history this committee know have solemn obligation not idly squander what many americans have fought died for ronald reagan's great ally margaret thatcher said this let never

work yet will see all september request those hearing room remain seated until capitol police have escorted witnesses members from room without objection committee stands adjourned whereupon 10:45 p.m committee was adjourned congressional record volume 168 number tuesday january 2022 senate pages s267-s272 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov h.r 5746 warren madam president rise today urge senate take action protect voting rights defend our democracy voting foundational our democracy strong functioning democracy playing field level citizens have right vote neither one side nor other has right block those voters from ballot box from getting their votes counted basic premise longer holds america let's blunt american democracy under attack from republican politicians past year alone republican state legislatures have passed laws nearly states restrict american citizens right vote republican nominees supreme court have destroyed longstanding protections against dark money politics have given green light partisan gerrymandering have gutted voting rights act republican dark money networks are bankrolling voter suppression efforts with hundreds millions dollars lobbying advertising for years years republican donald trump republican politicians have spread lies about integrity our elections last january republican president backed republicans right here this senate provoked deadly insurrection our nation's capitol intervening year republican leaders have refused accept evidence president biden's million-vote victory over donald trump instead have fed conspiracies lies further undermine our democracy yes american democracy under attack today democratic senators agree right response this attack freedom vote act would guarantee every american citizen can easily vote get their vote counted act would defend against attempts overturn will people act would reform our broken campaign finance system help root out dark money critically important act would ban partisan gerrymandering either side companion bill john lewis voting rights advancement act would restore historic protections against state laws have purpose effect discriminating basis race unfortunately senate republicans would rather destroy our democracy than have free fair elections support those around country who are trying block access voting who are trying rig how votes get counted elections are about will majority but republicans senate don't want what majority americans want fact republicans senate together represent 41\1/2 million fewer americans than democratic majority but instead taking simple vote protect american citizens access polls want stop legislation defend very foundation our democracy from even getting vote floor senate let clear view this filibuster has place our democracy our founders believed deeply protections for minority those are enshrined constitution structure congress but our founders made clear after extended debate majority could always get vote final vote--except case treaties impeachment--would always simple majority founders did not add filibuster with two exceptions insisted plain old majority rule when senate changed its rules decade later filibuster became favored tool racists segregationists filibuster preserved jim crow laws stalled civil rights legislation for decades filibuster helped block passage anti-lynching legislation for over 100 years filibuster nearly stopped congress from passing most important voting rights law our nation's history--the voting rights act 1965 today's filibuster does not foster bipartisanship compromise fact exact opposite true filibuster has been weaponized intensify partisan division filibuster wicked tool used kill legislation supported majority americans all political parties true for protecting right vote gun safety legislation immigration reform codifying roe wade filibuster thwarts will people today's filibuster doesn't encourage debate promotes power senators can torpedo bills without saying single word public even stepping floor u.s senate this not how so-called deliberative body should operate senators should required talk vote instead hiding behind rule should have put skin game republicans are fine with wave anti-voter laws being enacted state after state then should have come floor make clear republicans oppose reinstating voting rights act passed this chamber unanimously 2006 their constituents historical record should know exactly where stand instead because how today's filibuster works have two sets rules our country one for democrats who want promote civil rights liberties another set for republicans who want take them away republicans who want close polling places who want limit voting who want pass gerrymandered maps are hard work doing right now with simple majorities state legislatures all across this country face filibusters stop them majority rule all way here washington when republicans want pass massive tax cuts for billionaires rig our tax code favor big businesses exception filibuster lets them just with simple majority republicans who want pack supreme court with extremists justices who roll back fundamental rights who disregard rule law can with simple majority right here u.s senate but majority democratic senators--again democrats who together represent over million more americans than republican senators majority democrats cannot pass legislation improve lives americans democrats want raise minimum wage democrats want lower cost prescription drugs healthcare democrats want protect right vote but too often cannot achieve these goals because filibuster gives minority party almost total veto over legislation including legislation need save our american democracy can't ignore republicans attempts rig free fair elections this country can't roll over when republicans want make harder for black americans vote can't look other way when republicans want make tough for latinos asian americans vote page s268 can't silent when republicans make voting harder tribal lands can't shrink back when republicans work keep students from voting can't turn away when republicans try keep working-class people anyone who might more inclined vote for democrats--keep them away from polls not how democracy works democracy most votes win--period democracy senate debates then senate votes democracy people--not politicians--decide who will lead nation this week eyes nation entire world are u.s senate can choose protect tool jim crow segregation found nowhere constitution can choose defend sacred right vote urge senate protect our democracy protect right every american citizen vote have their vote counted some our republican colleagues have made dishonest claim there voter suppression crisis there need for federal voting rights legislation would like enter into record series articles demonstrate voter suppression taking place state after state this country will start reminding everyone supreme court--led chief justice john roberts--opened door all these anti-voter tactics gutting preclearance from voting rights act turning its back equal justice under law first will read excerpts from article published vox july 2021 entitled how america its commitment right vote supreme court justice elena kagan lamented dissenting opinion earlier this month has treated statute worse than voting rights act she's right voting rights act arguably most successful civil rights law all american history originally signed 1965 was united states first serious attempt since reconstruction build multiracial democracy--and worked just two years after president lyndon johnson signed voting rights act into law black voter registration jim crow stronghold mississippi skyrocketed from 6.7 percent nearly percent yet trio cases--shelby county holder 2013 abbott perez 2018 brnovich dnc 2021)--the court drained nearly all life out this landmark civil rights statute after brnovich decision inspired justice kagan's statement court has treated voting rights act worse than any other federal law it's unclear whether supreme court would rule favor voting rights plaintiffs even state legislature tried outright rig election these cases are culmination more than half century efforts conservatives who after failing convince elected lawmakers weaken voting rights turned unelected judiciary enact policy would never have made through congress all this bad news for minority voters america who are most likely disadvantaged many new restrictions currently being pushed statehouses across america for country's relatively young commitment multiracial democracy there are least three reasons fear decisions like shelby county brnovich foreshadow even more aggressive attacks right vote first republican partisans can use race proxy identify communities with large numbers democratic voters according pew research center percent non-hispanic black voters supported democrat joe biden over republican donald trump--and that's after trump slightly improved his performance among african americans compared 2016 means state lawmakers who wish prevent democrats from voting can through policies make harder for black voters lesser extent most other nonwhite voters cast ballot republican lawmakers haven't been shy about doing federal appeals court wrote 2016 about north carolina law included many provisions making harder vote new provisions target african americans with almost surgical precision even starker example georgia recently enacted law effectively enables state republican party disqualify voters shut down polling precincts state gop wields this law close down most polling places highly democratic majority-black city atlanta it's unclear voting rights act that's been gravely wounded three supreme court decisions remains vibrant enough block them second reason concerned about decisions like brnovich supreme court's attacks voting rights act are not isolated are part greater web decisions making much harder for voting rights plaintiffs prevail court these cases include decisions like purcell gonzalez 2006 which announced judges should very reluctant block unlawful state voting rules close election crawford marion county election board 2008 which permitted states enact voting restrictions target largely imaginary problems rucho common cause 2019 which would ban federal courts from hearing partisan gerrymandering lawsuits because court's gop-appointed majority deemed such cases too difficult adjudicate finally decisions like shelby county brnovich are troubling because court's reasoning those opinions appears completely divorced from actual text constitution from text federal laws such voting rights act shelby county eliminated voting rights act's requirement states with history racist election practices preclear any new voting rules with officials washington was rooted what chief justice john roberts described principle all states enjoy equal sovereignty principle never mentioned once text u.s constitution brnovich court upheld two arizona laws disenfranchise

presumption voting restrictions were place 1982 are lawful similar presumption favoring state laws purporting prevent voter fraud--[qualifications which have basis whatsoever law's text justice kagan writes dissent brnovich mostly inhabits law-free zone doesn't necessarily mean this supreme court will allow any restriction voting stand--under most optimistic reading cases like brnovich court might still intervene georgia tries close down most polling places atlanta--but does mean voting rights lawyers their clients can longer expect their cases simply because congress passed law protecting their right vote rules american elections are now what justice roberts his five even more conservative colleagues say are--not what constitution any act congress has say about voting rights president

entitled crystal mason was sentenced five years behind bars because voted whenever hear republican rants about widespread voter fraud supposedly undermining americans faith integrity their elections remember story crystal mason mason 46-year-old grandmother from fort worth area has been news off since 2016 when texas prosecutors decided was vote fraudster dangerous justice demanded sentenced five years behind bars her offense visiting her local precinct election day year casting provisional ballot for president mason was not eligible vote time because was supervised release after serving prison term for federal tax fraud texas like many states bars those with criminal records from voting until have finished all terms their sentence mason who had only recently returned home her three children had gone polls day urging her mother said did not realize wasn't allowed cast ballot when poll workers couldn't find her name rolls assumed was clerical error suggested fill out provisional ballot provisional ballots are useful way deal with questions about voter's eligibility can't resolved polling place since 2002 congress has required states offer them part help america vote act law passed aftermath 2000 election debacle when millions ballots were disqualified mason's ballot was rejected soon search database determined was ineligible other words system worked way was intended tarrant county prosecutors went after her for illegal voting anyway said page s272 should have known was not allowed vote state had sent her letter telling her back 2012 shortly after had been sentenced tax fraud case letter was delivered her home even though had already begun serving her sentence behind bars sent one place knew was not going said alison grinter mason's lawyer prosecutors also pointed out when cast her ballot 2016 signed affidavit saying had completed all terms her sentence mason said had not read fine print was focused writing down her address exactly form appeared her driver's license was convicted after one-day trial sentenced five years behind bars for casting ballot was never counted it's surreal experience courtroom for these trials said christopher uggen professor law sociology university minnesota who has studied impact felon disenfranchisement for decades has testified expert prosecutions people charged with illegal voting you've got judges you've got lawyers you've got somebody who often model probationer called what's issue whether voted have overriding sense gosh don't have other crimes prosecute really should consensus issue democracy don't incarcerate people for voting uggen said there stronger case for criminal punishment certain election-law offenses like campaign finance violations sabotaging voting machines can more widespread damage our election system but his own work has found people who get punished are more likely fit mason's description female low-level offenders who are doing relatively well community these are not typically folks who represent some great threat public safety said wouldn't get sense from how mason has been treated after her voting conviction federal judge found had violated terms her supervised release sentenced her extra months behind bars punishment which began serving december 2018 earned her credit toward her five-year state sentence mason has continued fight her case but far has every step march three-judge panel state appellate court rejected her challenge her sentence court reasoned broke law simply trying vote while knowing was supervised release didn't matter whether knew texas prohibits voting people circumstance this appears clear misapplication texas election law which criminalizes voting only people who actually know are not eligible not those who like mason mistakenly believe are it's though mason had asked police officer what local speed limit was responded beat's why don't start driving see pull over last week texas court criminal appeals state's highest court for criminal cases agreed rule mason's appeal it's her last chance avoid prison for voting tossing her conviction would bring small measure justice woman whose punishment should have been limited most not being able cast ballot but wouldn't give her back last four years fear uncertainty has endured for good reason mason's first grandchild was born few months ago another reminder how much would miss

someone else's hands because simple error identifying errors like these whole point offering provisional ballots crazy quilt voting rules regulations americans face from state state can trip even best-informed voters honest mistakes are common prosecuting mason just one more than 44,000 texans whose provisional ballot 2016 was found ineligible state saying attempt participate democracy your own risk risk almost always higher for people color texas attorney general ken paxton likes brag about 155 people his office has successfully prosecuted for election fraud last years--an average fewer than per year what doesn't say out loud what a.c.l.u texas found analysis cases has prosecuted almost three-quarters those cases involved black latino defendants nearly half involved woman color like mason this point might wondering why mason was ineligible vote first place had been released from prison after all was trying work her way back into society more states are coming understand there good argument for denying vote people with criminal record that's before consider practice's explicitly racist roots there even strong case made for letting those prison vote maine vermont most western european countries yet today more than five million americans including mason are unable vote because criminal conviction has far greater impact state national elections than any voter fraud has ever been uncovered given disproportionate number black brown people caught criminal justice system it's not hard see connection between cases like mason's broader republican war voting which often targets people who look like her nation's tolerance prosecutions for act casting ballot reveals complacency about right vote uggen said troubling degree comfort with voting restrictions generally there's slippery slope start exempting individuals from franchise it's easy exempt other individuals defining them outside citizenry said what shocking people view this acceptable political

committee will come order without objection chair authorized declare recess committee any time now recognize myself for opening statement coronavirus pandemic has put tremendous strain america's families caregivers many have seen firsthand our own families with our friends among our co-workers difficult challenges parents teachers other caregivers have faced last few years first several months pandemic families childcare providers were largely left face these challenges alone result many were forced drop out work force close their businesses approximately percent childcare providers closed spring these closures led over 375,000 childcare workers losing their jobs although many those childcare providers were able reopen thousands providers had closed permanently 2021 contributing shortage persists this day these sudden closures forced many parents make difficult choices between keeping their jobs caring for their children without necessary support parents with young children dropped out work force early days pandemic alarmingly high rates now nearly two years later men with young children have returned work force pre pandemic rates yet labor participation rate women with young children has not fully recovered january 2022 most recent month for which data are available more than 1.1 million women left job job due need care for young children this disparity threatens exacerbate longstanding gender-based economic inequality families paid high costs for children even before pandemic with onset pandemic childcare became even less affordable parents with prices rising more than percent 2022 time childcare costs for families were increasing childcare worker pay remained low most states median wage for childcare workers who are disproportionately women minorities was below state's living wage this combination low wages high costs unsustainable puts great burden childcare providers families while slowing our economic recovery congress has taken decisive action passing three federal pandemic relief packages each included funding specifically for childcare most significantly american rescue plan included historic billion investment childcare this investment has already had positive impact children providers early evidence indicates these pandemic relief funds have helped childcare providers stay business raise wages forty-six percent childcare providers surveyed summer 2021 said program likely would have closed without help from pandemic relief funds encouragingly many recipients relief funds also reported their childcare workers have received increased compensation american rescue plan also gave financial support directly parents families offset rising costs childcare temporarily expanded child tax credit delivered advanced monthly payments 300 per young child from july through december 2021 american families have put these funds good use census bureau data shows between million households used child tax credit advance payments help cover childcare expenses american rescue plan also expanded child dependent care tax credit providing additional assistance specifically for care although pandemic-related relief programs have helped families providers cope with immediate effects coronavirus sustained federal investment still needed aid recovery address problems existed before pandemic biden-harris administration's build back better agenda includes comprehensive proposals improve quality affordability childcare while delivering compensation childcare workers educators deserve continued investment childcare sector through existing federal programs extension american rescue plan provisions would also support access affordability extending expanding child tax credit with this advanced monthly payment structure would continue aid millions households have used those payments for childcare expenses when support american families invest professionals who help care for our nation's children are making investment both our present our future time now invest childcare providers families can build better stronger more equitable economy would like thank our witnesses for being here today look forward hearing more

damage u.s covid policies have done our nation's children well working parents parents pleaded with their local school boards inject actual science common sense these rules congressional republicans have sent letters asked for hearings briefings begged cdc explain science justified harm their ridiculous policies were causing our kids here what know remote learning hurt children both academically emotionally scheduling disruptions school daycare centers created chaos for working families hindering them from returning work force time when need more workers clearly one largest u.s failures policy have seen during this pandemic many democrat-led states teachers union bosses refused reopen schools for more than year some places despite evidence closures instability harm america's children summer republicans repeatedly called governors school systems fully reopen schools student learning due remote hybrid learning astronomical millions kids are behind math reading amplify which curriculum assessment provider examined its test data for about 400,000 elementary school students found middle 2021-2022 school year every elementary grade through number students risk not reading higher than was same point 2019-2020 school year chairman would like submit four different studies into record have been done detail data detrimental impact remote learning has had america's children thank scalise top learning children teenagers are now experiencing mental health crisis historic proportions american academy pediatrics declared national state emergency children's mental health u.s surgeon general issued youth mental health advisory suicide attempts 12-to 17-year-old girls rose percent from early 2019 early 2021 this having devastating impact our young kids when kids have been able back school daycare cdc has pushed extreme quarantine policies especially for kids can't wear masks this means one kid class gets covid whole class shut down for days can imagine negative impact this having not only students but also their parents abrupt closures long quarantines mean miss work unexpectedly for many days time these disruptions are caused irrational covid policies continue this day many cases according survey new york times january more than half american children missed least three days school about percent missed more than week while percent students missed nine more days this keeps parents from returning work force data shows especially has had negative impact women top until last friday cdc said everyone over age two had wear mask even though worldwide most countries don't mask young kids school due harm causes those kids protection masks provide children unknown might very small cdc said kids should masked for last two years this something republicans congress well parents across country have been begging cdc change since have come learn much more about covid its largely minimal impact young kids compared well-documented massive damage masks remote learning are having young children over last few weeks have started see mask mandates lifted most major cities including new york chicago washington well los angeles restaurants other public spaces yet unbelievably mask mandates for children schools daycare centers remained their plan was force kids mask all day school daycare most cases even while are outside but yet adults would allowed maskless grocery stores restaurants bars course sporting events would like note here this hypocrisy some these nonsensical political science policies have been ongoing throughout entire pandemic prominent democrats have been caught ignoring their own masking rules while forcing those same rules children for last two years liberal elites have been spotted without masks hair salons met gala professional football games fancy restaurants many many more while those same hypocritical leaders shamed others who didn't comply with their nonsensical mandates but know now have had this covid miracle last few days just time for president biden's state union address last night saw just days ago biden's centers for disease control prevention finally update its mask guidelines new guidelines mean instead recommending nearly entire country mask indoors now only percent are recommended overnight more than percent country including kids schools don't have mask anymore should ask chairman what changed did science change again not medical science seemed like democrats had epiphany political science what new science here have excerpts from memo group called impact research which well-known democrat polling firm also happens where president biden's pollster works note memo way dated february 2022 just days ago this what said this assessment from poll not from medical science two-thirds parents percent teachers say pandemic caused learning voters are overwhelmingly more worried about learning than kids getting covid six americans describe themselves worn out pandemic more we''--and are talking about democrat-elected leaders right here--``the more talk about threat covid onerously restricting people's lives because more turn them against show them we're out touch with their daily realities wish was medical science were basing decisions but was poll just days before state union got them change course kind thing infuriating parents biden's cdc only loosening its masking requirements now democrats polling numbers are tank midterms are around corner during campaign joe biden promised repeatedly follow science but apparently science changes when his polling changes american people see right through these masking political theater guidelines will never forget how played politics with our children shuttering their schools masking their faces even doctors were noting harm those mandates were causing our children people have faith cdc this brazen political stunt further eroding what trust was left last night during state union president biden said let's stop looking covid-19 partisan dividing line way this from same president whose administration directed department justice investigate parents who were passionately expressing their first amendment speech rights opposition many these same regulations going school board meetings what did president biden's administration tried deem them domestic terrorists for going school board meetings expressing their views after last night president said stop using covid-19 partisan dividing line well think those parents wouldn't angry president biden paid them apology for things said about them allowed his administration continue call them names try shame them for standing for rights their kids are going continue push for medical science not political science let's free our children from this experiment has destroyed millions lives over these last two years with chairman yield back chairman clyburn thank ranking member for his statement would like say parent school board member not

childhood educator currently have year-old son almost two-year-old daughter i've been working with young children families for nearly years i'll begin today sharing experience being early childhood educator past director childcare center then share experience navigating challenges childcare during covid-19 pandemic parent from 2013 until june 2021 worked program called roots fruits preschool south portland maine began teacher was later hired director 2017 roots fruits was nationally accredited was highest quality rating own son attended age four watched him thrive program was able witness firsthand how high-quality early education can set children for lifelong success director became very intimate with joys challenges running childcare program was first foremost committed quality education for children our care there was always delicate balancing act enrolling enough children financially successful while keeping prices affordable families assuring there were not too many children enrolled for our standard care was important our organization serve diverse array families from variety backgrounds including income levels business structure our organization field general was set only way address increased costs including increasing staff wages was increase tuition rates for families keeping cost care accessible families meant keeping wages below certain level for staff this lack fair pay inability offer health other benefits high demands job recipe for teacher burnout stress sometimes turnover i'm sharing this information about pre-pandemic times because has everything with crisis found ourselves when march came around initial first wave covid-19 closed our school remained closed until mid-june when had clear guidelines about how run childcare program safely when finally had reopening plan was reduced enrollment just over half our usual functioning run program had raise tuition for families even this was not going enough projected deficit for year due associated with lower enrollment cost additional safety materials procedures thankfully during school year received ppp loan federal covid relief funds made possible for run our program these funds covered costs related additional cleaning supplies ppe helped cover losses from our closure lower enrollment were also able give some additional bonuses staff lieu hazard pay ultimately these funds helped significantly but was not enough keep open long term with razor-thin margins challenges present long before pandemic what needed truly sustainable was significant committed long-term financial investment from state federal funds could've chosen continue raise our tuition rates but this would put our organization's values offering care diverse families risk was for these reasons along with our board directors decided close roots fruits program june 2021 handed over keys building closed our doors permanently parent impact covid-19 childcare sector has been felt very challenging ways since roots fruits closed have had find new childcare arrangements for youngest child were able find amazing childcare provider who offers local in-home care however only part-time far more expensive than had budgeted for can truly afford have inquired about other childcare possibilities would better fit our budget however every program have spoken have waitlists some for years come understatement say constant persistent stress family figure out how afford high-quality childcare one small respite from this ongoing stress was receiving monthly child tax credit payments which went directly toward childcare costs without them i'm struggling figure out can continue work need remove myself from work force care for our young child can't help but reminded childcare workers are truly work force behind work force issues described today are not new but are built into childcare system has existed for many years pandemic has significantly exacerbated those issues high quality early education care backbone our society believe need fund accordingly our children families educators deserve nothing less thank for your time look forward your questions chairman clyburn thank very much forbes will now hear from stevenson stevenson are recognized for five minutes statement betsey stevenson ph.d professor public policy professor economics university michigan stevenson thank chairman clyburn ranking member scalise distinguished members committee appreciate invitation speak today u.s economy employment has evolved way makes childcare now central its functioning while childcare not woman's issue pandemic did have unique impact women evolution women's role economy helps explain how we've arrived this critical juncture while detail transition more written testimony let explain where we're currently women are now most educated workers our labor force start pandemic women held majority jobs our recovery from 2008 recession rise women's labor force participation drove strong recovery with two-thirds job growth going jobs held women families rely women's earnings our economy relies skills efforts women women's personal lives have also undergone profound shift result mothers with kids home pandemic hit were older with more education more likely working than mothers with kids home during previous recessions stepping out labor force for these mothers was less viable option yet for some these mothers was only option available two-thirds childcare centers had closed april number childcare workers dropped percent schools around country turned remote learning many remained remote partially remote for more than year pandemic made clear schools childcare both serve dual purpose educate care for children our childcare challenges are ongoing both because pandemic ongoing because our childcare infrastructure was inadequate prior pandemic while childcare disruptions have occurred across income spectrum have disproportionately impacted lower-wage workers single parents with devastating effects their employment earnings childcare-related constraints led more women than men losing jobs during pandemic however childcare disruptions affected work way beyond just job fifty-nine percent parents said their employment was affected turned down promotions changed employment paused education training fathers made these sacrifices even more frequently than mothers these decisions not only mean lower incomes for families but mean lower potential output for u.s economy even good economic times finding high-quality affordable childcare challenging for parents cost childcare particularly high-quality childcare prior pandemic made working too expensive for some parents yet childcare market still far from recovering due these inadequate levels access affordability research has found childcare particularly sensitive economic downturns recovers much more slowly than rest economy employment childcare remains more than percent below pre-pandemic levels even though non-farm employment remains only 1.9 percent below its february level american rescue plan authorized billion for childcare much which just now starting get disbursed while this crucial funding will serve needed emergency support for childcare infrastructure does not provide long-term structural support childcare needs early childhood educators generate enormous financial benefits engaging developmentally appropriate curriculum-based activities lead higher lifetime earnings for children their care yet childcare workers are some lowest-paid workers our country children need committed professionals provide care developmentally appropriate skills but few people have luxury gaining training early childhood education committing profession for hour particularly can make twice much seeking employment now target low pay one reason childcare has such high turnover workers compared other jobs education creating even further instability childcare sector pay childcare providers must will rise due market forces these market forces will also ultimately raise cost childcare making childcare thus labor market participation for parents even more unaffordable biggest economic problem u.s currently faces low labor force participation it's likely contribute ongoing inflation solving this problem requires investing more our youngest citizens supporting their families with more reliable affordable higher-quality childcare sector thank welcome your questions chairman clyburn thank stevenson will now hear from austin austin are recognized for five minutes statement

services with poverty level wages paid them pandemic didn't create these circumstances but exacerbated them brought childcare this country brink collapse unfortunately it's wonder care early education work performed almost exclusively women has long been de-valued childcare businesses most which are small women-owned operate very thin margins slightest drop enrollment income was all took for many permanently close july childcare providers california for example had already fallen behind mortgage rent payments for their business most childcare programs have rely what parents can afford pay fund their programs this renders childcare workers we've heard among lowest-paid workers every state with average wage about hour within see racial pay gaps pay penalties especially for those who are working with youngest children our infants toddlers for programs have managed stay open they're having trouble staffing simply can't compete with businesses like retail food service which are now paying starting wages more also offering benefits it's not hyperbole say conditions are dire for childcare work force ninety-eight other occupations this country are paid more than childcare workers poverty rates are double those other workers general average eight times higher than k-8 teachers another study found third childcare workers surveyed were food insecure fewer than percent would able withstand 400 emergency these findings aren't unique california researchers have identified similar financial stressors states for example like nebraska louisiana oregon bring attention their persistently low wages for decades childcare workers have posed this riddle why did childcare worker cross road get her second job wasn't meant funny then certainly joke today colleague caitlin mclean met shania bell childcare worker who literally crossed street for better-paying job hardware store every day walking past job children loved was really good for job allowed her actually pay her bills similar scenario playing out all across country evidenced program closures childcare jobs shortages have date 131,000 childcare jobs since february federal pandemic relief programs have provided important stopgap measures many states jumped opportunity invest their work force know least are specifically using federal relief funds intentionally support wages recruitment retention early educators critically relief has helped many hold but cannot nor was designed provide long-term fixes our economy relies workers who are parents many parents cannot work without reliable childcare childcare cannot work effectively until its own work force secure dependable long-term investments de-couple what parents can afford from what workers are paid key ensuring childcare programs are able stay open recruit retain staff who can meet america's childcare needs appreciate opportunity appear before committee look forward your questions chairman clyburn thank austin will now hear from lukas lukas are recognized for five minutes lukas oops sorry statement carrie lukas president independent women's forum lukas good afternoon carrie lukas president independent women's forum independent women's forum non profit organization dedicated developing advancing policies aren't just well-intended but actually enhance people's freedom opportunity well-being also mother five kids between ages going quickly run through what think five key lessons learned during covid-19 about childcare supporting families caregivers first most importantly should reject any public policy changes would make our childcare preschool systems function more like our through public schools like many working parents during covid-19 had juggle job along with managing kids schooling online where live most private schools provided in-person learning service fall but our public schools fought stay closed for another seven months was long after made any sense from covid health perspective long after our teachers had been given priority access vaccines long after was obvious was utter catastrophe terms emotional health learning for students particularly for children from low-income families those with disabilities those for whom english second language failures our through schools contrast with childcare sector height pandemic according hhs about percent childcare centers closed rest stayed opened serve children critical workers end however estimated percent daycare preschool childcare programs had reopened contrast end only about third through public schools were providing fully in-person services public schools behaved this way because not see parents students their customers why would their ability pay bills keep their jobs depends pleasing government officials not serving families parents should fight keep this from becoming same situation for childcare preschools second big takeaway policymakers all levels government should seek eliminate regulations aren't directly related safety quality greater diversity providers especially smaller-and at-home providers enter marketplace parents have more better options other witnesses have attested covid has forced many daycare providers out business but all know sadly this was bad trend was already ongoing number at-home daycare providers fell half between 2005 2017 review state-based childcare regulations reveals ludicrous examples rules dictate minutiae care number art supplies have have exact size balls per children this clearly isn't necessary for kids just creates headaches drives costs for providers third policymakers should consider tax relief for those who have very young children since often face large expenses however policymakers should not make financial support conditional childcare arrangements incentivizing use paid childcare isn't fair all families with loved ones--parents grandparents aunts uncles--who provide loving care for children their lives for free while foregoing paid employment fourth government funding for childcare often sold surefire way improve life outcomes for children however evidence simply doesn't bear this out recent study tennessee their state-run pre-k program revealed had long-term negative effects children's achievements behavior now doesn't mean study will ever find benefits associated with preschool nor does mean daycare childcare isn't vital service for millions children families but should encourage some more humility caution among policymakers warn away from trying push all children into government-approved childcare centers since could more harm than good finally recent proposed build back better plan would have made federal government biggest player daycare preschool programs this approach incredibly dangerous should rejected put aside enormous cost taxpayers potentially for millions families these government regulations will discourage innovation create less diverse childcare sector fact all battles see raging about public through schools over content curriculum use pronouns sex masking policies will coming your local daycare preschool government becomes primary funder sets rules for what constitutes approved daycare provider see some this happening already with head start know right now everyone's unmasking but not poor 2-and 3-year-olds are our head start programs seems tragedy two-year-olds shouldn't political footballs for federal officials need keep federal government far away possible from deciding what happens daycare preschool thank chairman clyburn thank lukas finally will hear from fraga fraga are recognized for five minutes pronouncing name correct fraga frah-gah correct thank chairman chairman clyburn thank statement lynette fraga ph.d chief executive officer child care aware america fraga chairman

half parents with children under age six searching for care past two years said greatest barriers access were cost lack available spaces location this partly due specific impacts pandemic childcare providers are experiencing higher operating costs challenges retaining their work force lower fluctuating attendance which directly impacts their financial viability even before pandemic supply childcare was decreasing price childcare was out reach for parents insufficient public investment childcare has left families childcare providers bear financial burden supporting unsustainably

states have made progress february 2022 states district columbia launched their stabilization grant applications good examples have emerged how states many partnership with intermediaries like childcare resource referral agencies are ensuring stabilization grant process equitable efficient transparent states have also made progress spending their discretionary funds most common policies nationwide have included increasing subsidy eligibility eliminating co-pays for families increasing compensation benefits for educators improving provider payment policies this welcome news given

children waters thank very much hope scalise heard scalise would gentlelady yield would happy waters gentlelady has time laughter scalise clear will answer your question time chairman clyburn now your time scalise well thank chairman laughter scalise followup where gentlelady from california left off was guess criticizing politics frankly would share with her same criticism problem was quoting president biden's polling firm there was science cdc fell change guidance was polling firm from president biden said literally days before cdc changed guidance two-thirds parents percent teachers say pandemic caused learning voters are overwhelmingly more worried about learning went say more talk''--``we being democrats--``the more talk about threat covid onerously restrict people's lives because more turn them against show them we're out touch with their daily realities then went say democrats continue hold posture prioritizes covid precautions over learning how live world where covid exists but does not dominate risk paying dearly for november president biden's polling firm just days ago released this memo warning democrats their radical positions covid are hurting their chances winning november then cdc turned around changed their rules now have been urging them change rules for long time because their rules were wrong but wouldn't because was hurting kids did because their pollster told them was going hurt their chances getting elected november foster would gentleman yield for question scalise political science president biden's polling firm laid out would happy yield foster are presenting evidence affected their decision rather than simple fact amount virus circulation has been dropping like rock when virus circulation drops low enough level longer need masks scalise reclaiming time have seen circulation drop previous months yet didn't change guidance from cdc for know what know again there history within white house manipulating science their decisions based influencing here polling influence saw teachers union influence their recommendation schools past well documented way have talked about this committee before biden administration has history despite joe biden candidate saying are going follow science has manipulated science past about union bosses now manipulating science bow his own horrible polling would happy way submit this for record chairman this was memo february 2022 from president biden's polling firm where made these recommendations this based upon scalise now would like get some questions lukas appreciated your recommendation waters glad got clear lukas your recommendations very much appreciate want talk about damage have seen with kids have had many hearings this committee where talked about damage kids are experiencing classroom from not learning properly are not classroom but also even masking guidelines what doing psyche our young children suicides through roof again looking data suicide attempts 12-to 17-year-old girls are percent from early 2019 2021 can explain how cdc's flawed guidance has actually contributed mental health crisis see our young kids facing lukas well certainly mean interesting because different localities have made different decisions when comes how handle schools there have been some schools have been open providing in-person learning can see differences where schools have been closed longest there has been greatest learning losses then these increases mental health other issues including rising obesity from kids being prevented from sports all these are contributing problems when come school closures with masking will interesting because this tremendous experiment have been conducted young children knew young children are not very vulnerable covid covid-19 was know mercifully gentle with kids kids risks are low don't yet know all damage have done terms kids speech development know speech development there are evidence there have been declines but mental health impact will discovering for years come just how damaging this has been this next generation scalise thanks know from other studies kids who don't learn proficiently especially reading some basic skills don't read for example third grade are more likely leave school without diploma than proficient readers look these disparities where again some school systems followed science stayed open some bowed unions closed know what kind damage this going cause our kids long term lukas yes mean mckinsey company just came out with study showed there estimated net learning because learning gaps have been created school closures about 50,000 potential income future this isn't evenly distributed obviously places where in-person learning was denied for longest which tended overwhelmingly lower-income minority communities were disproportionately affected will have longest harm long term scalise well thanks chairman will try get study see can get included record later thank very much chairman clyburn thank very much chair now recognizes himself for five minutes fraga want know ask questions about billion support for childcare recovery including billion for stabilization grant providers want know how important think these stabilization grants are fraga thank for question chairman clyburn well every state has actually approached stabilization grants differently there have been number trends have seen across country support equity efficiency transparency distribution stabilization grants clear these grants have been incredibly helpful for states for example realm equity populations like infants toddlers those programs who are open during non-traditional hours some states there are additional tiers support for those programs efficiency are seeing distribution funding being through direct deposits for example though are available for checks simple opt out processes some states ability for there some level efficiency also transparency which incredibly important wealth information who has applied for been approved for ability able receive grants these are all ways these stabilization grants have been able helpful for programs for providers for families can able access programs have really seen tremendous amount effort are now almost all states who have least applications online folks can access them are seeing thousands these grants being distributed providers who really need real time chairman clyburn well thank for want back ranking member talked about child needing reading third grade what catastrophic consequences are former public school teacher want ask are familiar are keeping with how this billion being spent what kind programs coming forward because particularly interested fact keep talking about grade school aren't talking about those childcare centers got closed when kids were years old what would happen then when finally get school because childcare centers were closed fraga yes chairman clyburn these kids weren't getting anything preparation head start nothing might use double negative can tell about billion fraga course yes think one initial sort most important things need emphasize critically important for childcare programs affordable accessible quality really where lot our intention what are seeing happening states ensure accessibility comes way families lowering eligibility for programs ensuring for programs are getting supports need order stay open grant funding need can stay open need ensure are thinking about what are seeing trend data right now there are real intentional dollars going fact again your point some these programs have closed either temporarily leading permanent closure what impacts are inability for parents able access quality childcare for these families able return work for children able nurtured safe quality settings where these dollars are going order support whole system care which incredibly important for our children for our families talk about issues related mental health stress those are not only experiences children classrooms early childhood programs but this impacting parents who can't get work can't get food table can't able pay bills this affecting children their stress levels well going take whole system approach order really make difference need look robust long-term public investments make these kinds things reality chairman clyburn well thank very much for could get deeper into this but don't want jordan get too nervous chair now recognizes jordan for five minutes jordan thank chairman september last year national school board association sent letter biden administration asking them implement use patriot act against moms dads showing school board meetings five days later attorney general united states sends memorandum director fbi doing exactly what school boards association asked biden administration namely says memorandum i'm directing fbi working with united states attorney general convene meetings set open dedicated line communication for threat reporting set snitch line parents two weeks later october because whistleblower--because whistleblower--we find out fbi then sent email agents around country where say apply threat tag parents put this label this designation parents here what whistleblower told said believe this email evidence fbi proceeding collect information parents who protest school board meetings all happens days first question would ask have never seen federal government move fast anything but all happens days which made wonder about because learned actually didn't start with school board's letter know department education biden administration went school board didn't come from school board government government went school board say give pretext what want namely after moms dads his opening statement lukas chairman this committee said--this quote--``give parents support need think what federal government needs quit treating parents domestic terrorists maybe should start there think your opening comments lukas said had five children right lukas yes jordan your kids school right lukas public school here jordan all public school right here right across lukas fairfax county jordan right across river fairfax county virginia ever show school board meetings lukas have jordan been few them lukas just one jordan did speak out lukas certainly did jordan think there threat tag associated with your name now fbi lukas don't know guys would have tell who listening possible certainly concern know type concern discourages lot parents from speaking out for just those reasons jordan yes think goal think try intimidate parents from speaking out covid policies crt frankly anything care about speaking out about their kids education think effort intimidate chill first amendment free speech would agree with lukas very much jordan yes what did speak out about just curious when spoke out your school board meeting what did speak out about lukas about masking policy this was after governor youngkin had provided executive order give parents right unmask kids were denied right suspended when tried exercise right went tell school board thought was inappropriate abusive policy jordan what kind response did get from school board lukas nothing yawned kept school mask policy took another act law some brave finally bipartisan push back from parents demanding our kids unmasked since everybody else virginia essentially had been unmasked for long time there was tremendous concern about what was doing kids jordan well seems science has been pretty clear this with kids for long time ranking member scalise pointed out earlier why think continue then lukas know think became bit political symbol because mostly think because think can think public school parents are captive audience very expensive leave role private school didn't have would just add quickly know think talk about problems with childcare decline services happened during covid-19 think should kind imagine counter factual our childcare centers had been run like our public through schools like build back better plan had been place where government was primary funder schools just how more pronounced problems would have been because all those schools would have had same incentives our public schools did would have denied person service for long humanly possible certainly did virginia jordan yes just amazed everything told was wrong mean remember joe biden telling when ran for job had plan mean obvious didn't told would never impose vaccine mandate did much supreme court had say was unconstitutional told this virus didn't come from lab was gain-of-function didn't involve our tax dollars all three those things look like were false told vaccinated couldn't get told vaccinated couldn't transmit told there was such thing natural immunity there are eight lies eight pieces misinformation told then forever told moms who know little bit more about their kids than government does told them have put mask your kid mean just crazy got little discussion earlier about politics was totally about politics anyone with common sense can see just want read one last time what--well guess won't read because are cutting them off even though everyone else got over time chairman clyburn your time jordan chairman yield back yield back chairman clyburn well want yield for question would glad over because would like know whether not free speech school board meeting allows one say school board member know your address just want know know your address way address school board policy jordan chairman clyburn just asking jordan what asking when moms dads names get designation label associated with their name fbi keeps call crazy but think has potential chill speech would argue exactly what were trying evidenced fact was secretary cardenas who went school board association asked them send letter prompted this whole thing within days got fbi send email out whistleblower gave us--thank goodness for this whistleblower--where this whistleblower said this not how supposed operate what know now have seen impact has had parents across country point has been about politics again would just read what scalise chairman clyburn every terrorist country has ever been arrested think had children jordan well appreciate profound wisdom chairman clyburn with chair yields mrs maloney for five minutes response chairman clyburn mrs maloney mrs maloney thank thank chairman pandemic has made clear affordable quality childcare plays essential role promoting gender equity economic opportunity forbes understand are parent young child well early childhood educator have dealt with tradeoffs between furthering your career obtaining quality childcare for your child can discuss how lack affordable available childcare has impacted your ability work develop your own career forbes absolutely thank for your question congresswoman has been ongoing challenge since even had older son 2008 where just question how can work for wages are not much higher perhaps same what would pay out for cost childcare just no-win situation particularly now raising young child pandemic with additional stresses has just been untenable situation every day figuring out can work tomorrow can work next week can continue teach field needs desperately need every educator show work there for other families yet don't know going able pay care provider this week next week mentioned opening statement expanded child tax credit was very helpful for came went right back out door pay for childcare costs without just everyday struggle know what next mrs maloney well thank think many parents have had same experience including myself federal reserve analysis showed onset pandemic caused many many parents young children drop out labor force with longer-lasting effects for mothers than for fathers mothers young children particular saw larger drop labor force participation than women without children professor stevenson could these pandemic impacts childcare availability have long-term ramifications for women's careers gender equity work force stevenson absolutely can one things highlighted testimony even need look beyond people who dropped out work because some people hung onto some kind work but different work than would doing had access better childcare kind reallocation continuing explains why see shortage workers today why see what people are calling great resignation great reallocation because people are trying figure out what spot for them economy which have had make sacrifices due childcare with few childcare spots available right now such high cost think going long time for women parents get back just want emphasize know think need realize this impacting men's careers well pains say maybe people will pay more attention when tell fathers are getting hammered here too but fathers are getting hammered overall u.s economy really depends parents having stable reliable childcare for both mothers fathers sake mrs maloney thank american rescue plan president biden signed into law last year already helping address this crisis home state new york used american rescue plan funds support 2.3 billion investment childcare early last year austin your center published analysis showing new york city one only areas where childcare employment was regained pre-pandemic level how american rescue plan supporting new york's childcare recovery what lessons can learned from new york's progress austin thank for your question new york city very interesting when look new york returning pre pandemic levels think there are couple things have happened there combination relief funds getting into community another really important point about new york city new york city has larger share publicly contracted childcare programs than see many places around country our research has found publicly contracted programs like state preschool programs head start programs which temporarily closed then did reopen most childcare reopened were more stable were able withstand pandemic better keep their programs open pay bills continue pay their staff think part what going new york city new york state whole also beginning see more recovery again with those relief dollars providing important relief keep people working those programs just last thing want say there think one thing important remember see this return pre-pandemic employment which important doesn't signal communities have totally recovered because course had incredible shortages childcare before pandemic hit but this does show pandemic relief dollars public contracts are helping programs move forward mrs maloney well definitely have more time has expired thank panelists for investing our childcare system yield back thank chairman chairman clyburn thank very much mrs maloney mrs miller-meeks for questions going hand chair foster can vote mrs miller-meeks thank very much chair recently heard this room have heard this before about pandemic being politicized left didn't politicize pandemic can someone help explain science democrat governors lifting mask mandates for adults but not for children schools them posing with children schools completely masked even though have low levels transmission almost infinitesimally low levels illness death but yet lawmaker being unmasked response mrs miller-meeks didn't think because there science would support masking children with adults unmasked having said would like thank our witnesses for coming before sharing their testimony today mothers disproportionately shouldered responsibility for children during remote hybrid schooling daycare disruptions many are unable return workplace because any given moment their child's class school childcare facility could shut down over single positive covid test with illness january 2022 male labor force participation rate was percent while female rate was just percent this likely related fact early january 2022 there were nearly 7,500 school closures due omicron surge even though knew there was little risk illness lukas how has instability school daycare systems contributed women's exodus continued absence from work force how can get women who choose work back work lukas yes know interesting because there has been drop-off both men women's labor force participation with children but actually labor force drop-off has been larger among parents school-age kids not childcare through which really focus this hearing which know absolutely need make easier for more childcare centers open people have those options reduce regulations kind forced closures really expensive disruptive policies have made running daycare center difficult but again think when look real problems with labor force participation lot driven not lack childcare about total undependability our public school system particularly democratic states where schools remained closed for more than year mrs miller-meeks according emails obtained americans for public trust american federation unions was provided pre-release copy cdc's updated school guidelines february 2021 pre-released version guidance written prior influence aft stated schools could provide in-person education regardless community transmission fact iowa governor reynolds opened schools in-person learning fall without significant consequence illness transmission super spreader events unfortunately cdc bowed pressure aft forcing thousands schools remain virtual fact aft's exact suggested language appeared cdc's final guidance lukas think fair teachers union had ability edit guidance lukas absolutely appalling think clarifying moment seeing one problems with how children have been treated pawns during this pandemic really really opened our eyes problems are inherent our public school system which did not prioritize children did not prioritize families during this pandemic why need change should not move direction moving toward public-funded government-controlled daycare system instead should thinking about how liberalize how give parents more leverage over our public school systems would more responsive care more about children's mental health development not sacrifice them did during covid mrs miller-meeks well said democrats unfortunately chose teachers union over teachers who wanted return school parents most importantly children now are seeing effects their harmful choices america's children are broken agree shouldn't cdc base its guidance off science lukas absolutely think interesting will learning about this years will having conversations about lasting damage has been done due school closures increased mental health problems not just for little kids who are forced mask are still masking today head start programs many daycare centers but have affected preteens vulnerable know among kids feel worst for middle-aged children such hard age think this has made just incredibly worse will seeing this for years come sadly mrs miller-meeks yes spiraling level youth suicides thank much chair yield back time foster presiding thank this point will yield myself for five minutes questioning when see our society coming under stress our labor market coming under stress one places look for lessons are greatest generation because have been here before there was tremendous labor force shortfall during world war one most fundamental successful ways plugging labor force shortage was rosie riveter but rosie riveter needed daycare response federal government stepped passed something called lanham act which was federal government setting bunch federally funded daycare centers result natural experiment learned lot about long-term benefits providing kids daycare stevenson could say little bit about this program what lessons learned have been stevenson yes noted was popularly known lanham act was also called defense housing community facilities services act 1940 because was attached defense industry were war needed try figure out how get women into factories issue was well their kids are going need childcare all families regardless income were eligible for what was really high-quality childcare very very low cost ton research has been done into what did for kids what did for families early research showed childcare strengthened family bonds children enjoyed childcare primary goal increasing mother's employment was achieved children's long term outcomes were improved saw these children went have higher high school graduation rates higher education rates general went earn more money adult give little bit math behind 100 lanham act funding increased high school graduation rates 1.8 percentage points--that super cheap way increase high school graduation 1.8 percentage points--college graduation rates 1.9 percentage points employment for these kids when grew were their late 40's early 50's percentage points increased earnings 1.8 percent these are big big effects think speak broader point which know high-quality early childhood education can have huge effects people's earnings adults idea investing more childcare not just about parents getting parents into work force lanham act did got moms into work force but did something even more important what think childcare really about which got those kids earn more adults going end with just giving one last fact which study was done just around decade ago found high-quality kindergarten teacher can generate 320,000 value increasing earnings kids are her classroom know don't know estimates for high quality preschool early childhood educator but reasonable say would probably around 100,000 more there lot these educators yet know simply don't have fundings pay people appropriately give all kids access foster big increase lifetime earnings will presumably also associated with big increase amount tax revenue collected from these people well don't have math see clearly case federal taxpayer with this investment paid off actually allowed lower tax rates over time because made this early investment from investment there any way around conclusion clearly true stevenson clearly true when look high-quality early childhood education what see about spending returns taxpayer down line got wait for because when are investing two-year old might not get all way back until are their 50's long wait but these are net present value numbers means adjusting for long wait still telling taxpayers get back long run know research parents parents even know this parents would make these investments themselves could afford know fact why very high-income parents make these investments other parents just are unable make choice unable afford making those high-quality investments their kids but taxpayers can would get money back foster thank time has expired one large number things greatest generation got right haven't re-learned yet this point will recognize representative raskin for five minutes raskin thank chairman heard ranking member announce apparently breathtaking discovery politicians take polls some even pay attention what majority believes would remind him president who responded neither science nor polls president whose lethal recklessness public health whose sickening pro-putin policies for four years did everything could obscure explain away donald trump's own covid-19 advisor deborah birx has said unnecessarily hundreds thousands people because failures donald trump who never developed plan combat defeat covid-19 but rather trivialized denied waved away hocked fake miracle cures like hydroxychloroquine injecting yourself with bleach did everything could prevent from creating social cohesion needed defeat disease finally have under president biden here's poll donald trump his party should consult vast majority american people reject fascist vladimir putin's war imperial aggression against democratic nation ukraine vast majority americans reject vast majority world rejects but trump who has been trying undermine nato for many years now calls his hero vladimir putin genius mike pompeo quickly called him savvy professed his admiration fascist trump follower nick fuentes called for round applause for russia just couple days before invasion right wing rally florida crowd then began chant putin putin putin marjorie taylor greene paul gosar joined this pro-russian circus extremism now joe biden has finally turned corner covid created forged social consensus need defeat disease turn corner brought numbers down now our colleagues rather than acknowledge great success breakthrough have under president biden never came close under trump when disease was spinning out control now what well everything can distract from humiliating record trump both covid-19 vladimir putin two plagues helped circulate throughout land throughout world just shocked see continue come back here summon all their counterfeit outrage against after was donald trump who spread plague across land just like continues help try spread plague right-wing authoritarianism around world will one our republican colleagues--one them denounce donald trump dissociate themselves from his remarks praising vladimir putin calling him genius cheerleading for right-wing authoritarianism march against free people ukraine wish one them would now response raskin well hearing none then would like ask question beginning with forbes question for about american rescue plan's temporary expansion child dependent care tax credit which will allow families least offset substantial portion their childcare costs this tax filing season expansion allows low-and middle-income families get refundable credits 4,000 for families with one child 8,000 for families with two more children actually let ask professor stevenson first how might expanded child dependent care tax credit affect parents ability participate effectively labor market stevenson thank think tax credit just incredibly important help offset cost going work bottom line some parents cannot afford work mean sounds like crazy sentence say can't afford work but actually heard forbes describe her exact predicament not being able afford work when look these kind tax credits are primarily meant offset cost childcare parents can work think are incredibly important right now when childcare costs more than has past tax credit really think was essential for helping get parents back into labor force will just end saying women have come back faster pace than men jobs women want come back work can help

years can hear all arguments--and colleagues will present awful lot arguments tonight tomorrow--as why need pass this act but for this personal personal experience had experience unfortunately many many families have had fact have shared this story have been really overwhelmed people reaching out saying too have very similar story how talking about brought out their willingness share their experience well addition understand how important protect roe wade protect right for women make critical decisions for themselves along with their doctor not have politics interfere with those decisions story involves first wife when were married was pregnant with child whom very much wanted were looking forward having second child fourth month towards end fourth month her water

someone's health caring about their life was about politics why have protect roe wade have protect right for women control their bodies control their reproductive health cannot decision made politicians here this body other places this real situation families face mentioned there was outpouring folks who have come who had similar situations think about michigan right now michigan has law books was written 1931 says all abortion prohibited our state doesn't matter whether not involves health mother doesn't matter life mother doesn't matter woman victim rape incest--it just simply not allowed think unconscionable what will happen real-life situation could happen court decides forward reverse roe wade situations like what former wife went through families all across america would not able have kind option think about exception for rape incest will have 17-year-old girl michigan who raped will have options know majority people united states believe unacceptable know majority people united states believe women have right make these most personal these most intimate decisions themselves with advice their physician whoever else want consult this not about politics this not about opinions folks who think know better let's preserve right women what think best why have pass women's health protection act why would urge all colleagues search their heart listen stories people will tell them understand right thing protect reproductive freedoms rights america yield floor presiding officer senator from maryland van hollen madam president first want thank friend colleague senator from michigan for coming floor share his own powerful personal story stories his constituents about why many are here senate floor this evening because days ago our country received terrible wake-up call leaked draft opinion from supreme court united states indicated majority five justices may verge overturning constitutional protections reproductive freedom set forth roe wade don't know this draft opinion will final decision but know there very high chance supreme court united states will soon blow years precedent strip women their constitutional right make choices about their own body their own self-determination while content this opinion shocking not totally surprising this premeditated outcome years--years--of plotting planning rightwing legal movement republican party candidate donald trump promised nation would handpick justices who would overturn roe wade campaign trail even claimed roe would overturned immediately once assumed office stated national television women who receive abortions should punished leader mcconnell senate republicans made their own rules then broke their own rules order play their part this scheme first senate republicans refused even hold hearing president obama's supreme court nominee merrick garland grounds was presidential election year four years later senate republicans rushed through one president trump's own supreme court nominees just weeks before election between senate republicans carved out exception senate filibuster rule could push through all three trump's anti-choice supreme court picks neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh amy coney barrett each these nominees raised their right hand before senate judiciary committee swore under oath respected weight judicial precedent fact when brett kavanaugh was asked about roe page s2410 wade pointed planned parenthood casey which affirmed core holding roe establishing constitutional right abortion called decision casey precedent precedent double precedent but let's very clear this draft opinion has respect for judicial precedent draft holds all three president trump's nominees supreme court along with some others already bench will have deliberately deceived defrauded american public rightwing ideologues set out stack court with justices ready willing overturn roe wade now this rightwing establishment this machinery verge achieving their goal even though their will horrible for reputation supreme court horrible for integrity our constitution most all horrible for american people more than half women girls reproductive age our country live states would likely ban severely restrict abortion supreme court overturns roe wade thirteen states have so-called trigger laws will kick into effect automatically day roe overturned nine states have passed laws were struck down past because violated protections roe but those laws could come back roe wade overturned many these laws are talking about are extreme one trigger law kentucky would ban all abortions any point pregnancy with exceptions for rape exceptions for incest situation which child could born with fatal birth defect another trigger law idaho would make providing abortion any point pregnancy under almost any circumstances felony crime punishable years prison texas law books right now would put doctors jail fine them 10,000 for prescribing pills for medication abortions through telehealth mail for women who are more than weeks pregnant law has been books since 1931 michigan would snap back into effect making nearly all abortions any point pregnancy felony women who undergo medication abortions would made felons even case rape incest just last week state legislators louisiana house advanced bill through committee would allow women who obtain abortions any time pregnancy prosecuted for murder--for murder experts say this extreme law could also used restrict emergency contraception vitro fertilization which critical process helps customers with infertility build their families like many our colleagues have been hearing from constituents constituents state maryland who have learned just how dangerous this situation for women families across country one constituent named connie shared her story taking emergency contraception after was attacked raped stranger age told about importance being able make choice about her body her future instead potentially becoming pregnant because rape today connie social worker therapist has wonderful son have received other testimonials from constituents across state maryland who have shared their stories expressed their deep concern fear about court striking down roe wade roe was overturned women living states where safe legal abortion banned will have travel away from their homes away from their communities away from their families simply exercise control over their own bodies those who lack money time will either forced carry unwanted pregnancy term find somebody performing abortions shadows their states throwback dangerous back-alley abortions 1965 years before roe wade decision illegal abortion accounted for percent--17 percent--of all deaths attributed pregnancy childbirth past could soon our present see this supreme court decision doesn't just turn back clock precedent turns back clock public health strips women their reproductive freedoms world where roe has been overturned drive across our great country your rights will change from state state cross each state border result taking away constitutional right why polling shows great majority american people not want supreme court take away rights under roe wade now proud represent state has codified woman's right reproductive choice fact during very first campaign for public office right reproductive choice was defining issue election maryland general assembly was another time when there was great fear supreme court might overturn roe wade ran pro-choice ticket after was sworn matter months colleagues passed bill 1991 codifying roe wade matter maryland state law but here thing laws like one have maryland laws like one passed back 1991 will chopping block this decades-long rightwing project continues according plan because republicans ultimate objective isn't just overturn roe wade enact federal law passed this senate house banning abortion nationwide last week leader mcconnell acknowledged national ban abortion was real possibility during interview with usa today should sound alarm bells all over america this has been two-step process step strike down constitutional protections roe wade prohibit elected officials whether state legislatures congress from enacting laws prohibit restrict unnecessarily right choose step seems are verge happening once clear way step enact federal law congress banning abortion everywhere country have seen exactly how extreme those laws can from state examples cited earlier could happen here this republican rightwing project sees its logical end federal law would supersede maryland's law congress passed law was enacted state laws like those maryland protecting right choose maryland would knocked off books true other state laws statutes protect woman's right choose woman america would safe obtain safe legal abortion such national law were enacted now everyone should also understand another huge danger posed draft its flawed logic not only would dismantle right abortion could also used strip away other rights protected constitution have read justice alito's draft opinion have read all pages this opinion justice alito tries distinguish this case abortion from other cases involving other individual rights alito claims this case special because involves abortion state's interest protecting life while other cases not well obvious its face but misses bigger danger alito's opinion because doesn't change fact justice alito's reasoning for dismantling right obtain abortion can used dismantle many other rights currently take for granted well justice alito claims even look entire constitution cannot find right choose for women cannot derive from constitution fact page draft opinion justice alito writes constitution makes reference abortion such right implicitly protected any constitutional provision follow justice alito's flawed logic same could said host other rights are not specifically named constitution constitution doesn't have word contraception constitution doesn't talk about consenting adults engaged sexual relations page s2411 look this thing over time supreme court has recognized components liberty through close analysis bill rights 14th amendment includes right use contraception right consenting adults have sexual relations with who choose right marry who love these are rights american people don't want elected officials take away whether are state legislatures members senate house but are all peril too logic alito's reasoning played out terrible irony--the terrible irony here those who most claim oppose government regulations any kind are now ones rushing regulate most intimate personal private aspects american life say don't want government having any role their life--get out way--except for when comes them taking away this right planning pass laws would ban abortion nationally said open door going after other liberties well those are stakes are facing gather here this evening anticipation tomorrow's vote why are taking this vote tomorrow why need pass women's health protection act but even fall short this time having vote now important important country democracy requires accountability important american people know where each senators stands this issue fundamental question move into november toward midterm elections american people will watching closely how members this body vote this fundamental constitutional question will look see who voted strip away constitutional rights who rose protect them believe majority this country--the overwhelming majority this country--wants stand protect fundamental liberties constitution united states yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut murphy madam president will probably get trouble with somebody for saying this but question when life begins deeper question what defines life which biological entities are alive possess independent existence versus which biological entities are simply part something else alive--man those are really hard questions heard colleague senator daines floor earlier tonight talking passionately about his belief life begins conception humans have obligation defend day-old fetus equally our obligation defend life someone who has been born now disagree believe life begins birth believe our legal obligation towards born human different than our legal obligation toward unborn fetus but narrow question when life begins don't cast any particular judgment senator daines for believing what believes his belief system shared millions americans--not majority americans but significant share this disagreement have over when legally protected life begins though significant important disagreement exists--right--because about most foundational questions human existence what life who decides whether woman bears child who has control over woman's body who has control over most sacred critical function human being act giving birth just doesn't get any more important than set questions given this fundamental disagreement given weightiness these questions given large number americans who sit either side these questions come one simple conclusion government group politicians should make this decision for anyone else this decision about whether abort pregnancy morally complicated socially divisive should must left individuals--in this case women--to decide over course history millions have died fights over another weighty moral issue--the question whether god exists god exists exactly what form being takes what requires humans disputes over religion have eradicated entire civilizations what does this have with roe wade well our founding fathers decided there were some topics were personal subject disagreement controversy government should just barred from registering judgment part reason why our civilization has not been plagued wars between religious groups--a reality continues paralyze societies this day other parts world--because keep government out question which god right god every american decide for themselves even though many americans believe consequence observing following wrong god serious--eternal damnation for some stakes are huge when comes religion but government sits sidelines imperfect but instructive corollary debate over choice abortion decision about whether have abortion personal lack consensus country question unavoidable make government intervention just illegitimate would government tried dictate someone which religion should follow now not exact route supreme court traveled get roe decision but helps understand why from 1973 until today decision about whether not have abortion has been constitutional right individual not constitutional right government decide frankly has always been really hard for square how republicans who readily evangelize about small government about importance putting families their decision-making processes first about evil public sector overreach are enthusiastic about government micromanaging personal decisions about pregnancy marriage adoption small government great guess for corporations but not great when comes most intimate decisions families make have said this floor before also hard take seriously republicans passionate pleas for this body defend existence unborn fetus when seem care little about many existential threats are posed every american after are born today this day over 100 americans are going die from gunshot wounds from murders suicides whether republican colleagues agree with not stricter gun laws part solution this uniquely american epidemic plagues those are born don't know have ever heard republican speech dedicated this crisis floor senate have heard dozens dedicated cause those before birth seems after birth life matters little bit less some people this body what think said will probably get into some hot water for admitting understand arguments people like senator daines make don't agree with his views but understand them hope begin this debate over future reproductive choice health this country this debate heats up--because not going away are taking vote tomorrow but this debate going consume this nation alito opinion becomes law which believe will hope are honest about complexity this debate but republicans are equally honest claims make let just briefly tell what mean today heard republican senators making whole bunch claims are just ungrounded truth diminish quality what should very important debate very weighty subject for instance heard senators make claim protesters who were protesting outside near supreme court justices homes threatened violence against those justices was page s2412 explicit claim made people who came down this floor who might have heard some unreputable website but not true can object protesters being outside public officials homes has happened all way but don't make threats violence just because makes for better story heard one senator say women's health protection act for which will proudly vote tomorrow allows for garage abortions not true just plainly not true every state requires abortions performed licensed healthcare facilities nothing bill changes don't say just because makes better story many republicans claim bill are taking tomorrow allows abortions date birth not true either women's health protection act does codify roe wade but roe only protects woman's right have abortion without restriction until viability then afterward protects for woman's health risk death bill simply does not expand circumstances under which abortion can performed beyond what currently exists case law going honest with colleagues about admitted complexities--the political moral complexities this debate but expect opponents bill are debating tomorrow equally honest arguments make well will have lot more say about this topic begin what think debate will consume this nation rightfully over course coming weeks months but for today will leave there yield floor presiding officer senator from rhode island congressional record volume 168 number tuesday february 2022 senate pages s563-s567 from congressional record online through

senator from texas ukraine cornyn president many americans are watching news reading newspaper watching cable news are seeing russian buildup troops border ukraine thought what would take just few moments speak about what stake ukraine why should americans care what should response tensions along border are high shuttle diplomacy occurring order day but more than 100,000 russian troops are position should invasion ukraine ordered russian federation president putin reports indicate russia has created graphic propaganda video something called false flag operation serve pretext for invading cyber attacks like those might precede planned invasion are already underway not surprisingly kremlin engaging disinformation campaign making every attempt blame united states--or any other country for matter--for its own aggressive actions this kind gaslighting might work totalitarian state but rest world where have access more complete accurate information know better there question russia russia alone responsible for military buildup ukraine's border also threatening peace europe frederick kagan scholar american enterprise institute has written this isn't primarily ukraine crisis it's russia crisis more precisely putin-created crisis aimed destroying north atlantic treaty organization otherwise known nato it's putin's attempt drive united states its west european allies put ourselves time machine abdicate our alliance obligations expose countries previously occupied brutalized exploited soviet union putin's continued aggression demonstrate our unreliability partners show our unseriousness about defending our own vital national security interests return for promise nothing all united states has played part creating this crisis but believe have some responsibilities--not just treaty obligation our nato allies--because ukraine not yet member nato obligation under article does not apply ukraine will discuss moment but believe have responsibility support ukrainian people fight defend their own sovereignty despite fact are not members nato with many challenges home front though around world easy for folks texas massachusetts anywhere else around country wonder why should care what happening ukraine americans are experiencing highest inflation years there growing concern about violent crime have humanitarian crisis our southern border let's not forget ongoing fight against pandemic know families are struggling face challenges right front them let alone those other side globe americans want know how does conflict other side globe actually impact united states importantly why should help think those are fair questions human financial costs armed conflicts are very high have learned painful lesson during many times our nation's history twice last century europe alone where there were world wars centered but also know how much free world depends united states its leadership strength provide stability prevent wars promote peace can while safeguarding freedom democracy around world page s565 united states global power but are longer only one day has passed our leadership role responsibilities rules-based international order were earned sacrifices generations americans who defended our freedoms our way life those our allies believing ronald reagan said peace comes through strength america's role world has been achieved our military might our strategic alliances our commitment free markets trade around world have produced economy has allowed defend ourselves well unwavering dedication our values whether like not our unique role world brings with certain responsibilities can't give anyone--adversary ally--a reason doubt our commitment freedom peace stability security unfortunately our reputation for reliability has suffered some damage recently botched withdrawal from afghanistan for example caused our nato allies doubt future american leadership our commitments under north atlantic treaty our friends adversaries alike are wondering afghanistan debacle one-time misstep beginning dwindling u.s commitment power course putin will not miss opportunity disparage america's credibility reliable ally our urgent task our actions well our words should convince friend foe will remain credible friend ally but either way putin opportunist today eyes world are united states see how will respond this threatened russian aggression will stand strong support ukraine will sit passively sidelines make mistake russia doing far more than just threatening ukraine president putin told world speech 2005 collapse soviet empire--the soviet union--was what called greatest geopolitical catastrophe century his mindset putting empire back together was clearly his mind when russia invaded nation georgia 2008 formerly part soviet union when russia annexed crimea 2014 also part soviet order course can confident this foremost his mind threatens invade ukraine another country used part soviet union putin trying get away with much can would naive think will stop ukraine united states fails support ukraine this pivotal moment other authoritarian governments like those china iran will take note today's new york times had story said both sides taiwan strait are closely watching ukraine's crisis other words people's republic china--mainland china--as well taiwan independent democratic state right across thin band water known south china sea here what one representatives taiwan said this article said western powers fail respond russia embolden chinese thinking regarding action taiwan this not just about ukraine this not just about europe this about america's credibility our friends allies around world our willingness stand for our values defend our freedoms our adversaries see united states responds merely with passivity words too will inevitably see opportunities for them exploit would risk further geopolitical instability cause peace would inevitably diminish america's leadership position world global order which are what elbridge colby has termed cornerstone balancer powerful country anchoring coalition freedom-loving nations yes ukraine frontlines current crisis but security europe also question reach russia's aspirations for reestablished empire are well said there are global repercussions however choose respond not suggesting president biden send american troops ukraine want clear point know one calling for american troops deployed ukraine there are however concrete steps can take help ukraine defend itself without putting american lives line fortunately there precedent for early 1940s nazi germany was making dramatic advances across europe great britain was being pummeled blitz bombing campaign german air forces while britain was hanging thread prime minister churchill asked president franklin delano roosevelt for help from united states this ultimately resulted very creative successful solution known lend-lease act words president roosevelt this legislation transformed united states into arsenal democracy supplying great britain with materiel needed fend off german attacks compared lending your neighbor garden hose his house was fire wouldn't just protect neighbor's home would protect your home well congress american people agreed with president roosevelt's logic this legislation was signed into law march 1941 soon after american warships aircraft weaponry oil food other critical resources made their way across atlantic allied forces fighting against germany think this part response need provide today provide ukrainians with ability defend themselves under modern version 1941 lend-lease act with inspiration president roosevelt 1941 act have worked with number colleagues--republicans democrats alike--to draft 2022 version legislation called not surprisingly ukraine democracy defense lend-lease act which will ensure ukrainian forces ukrainian people will have what need deter defend against russian invasions stands today president united states has menu options support our international friends times conflict some cases such loan equipment united states will eventually retain end use others such grants emergency aid not recover funding assets sent our friends this bill would provide additional option menu allowing united states provide assistance may otherwise unfeasible unless could retain end use this legislation would authorize president biden enter into lend lease agreements directly with ukraine provide military equipment necessary protect ukrainian people ideal world access this materiel will help ukrainians defend themselves deter russia from mounting invasion first place knowing ukraine has access arsenal democracy could help prevent putin from risking deadly war but putin makes bad decision move forward ukrainian forces will have lethal weapons need defend their sovereignty will also have support united states our nato allies senate there clear support for this sovereignty ukraine glad have worked with colleagues this legislation includes this lend-lease component want thank chairman menendez ranking member risch foreign relations committee larger bipartisan group our colleagues who have been working comprehensive approach counter this threatened aggression russia have discussed lend-lease bill well additional security assistance lethal aid for ukraine have read senator menendez senator risch are negotiating limited but immediate sanctions response this aggression including cyber attacks well threat additional sanctions event invasion chairman ranking member have said negotiations are making some progress hope page s566 can wrap things quickly bring bill senate floor without much more delay fact are racing against clock putin could invade ukraine moment's notice not going wait u.s senate act why time essence ideally lend-lease agreement military assistance sanctions other provisions included this package will cause putin think twice about invading but can only happen act before putin acts clock ticking need move encouraged bipartisan support have seen for ukraine for this effort hope can take action soon reaffirm america's position lead defender global peace security yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut jcpoa murphy president world was safer when jcpoa iran nuclear agreement negotiated president obama was place world became much less safe place when president trump tore agreement against advice his secretary state his secretary defense have opportunity right now reconstruct agreement--or most important elements it--so iran once again far possible from being able obtain nuclear weapon would make region safer would make united states safer but time essence u.s negotiators european negotiators russians chinese iranians are right now entering what could last round discussions absolutely imperative u.s senate provide this administration with support needs effectuate agreement want talk colleagues for few minutes about how important for united states our european allies--for world indeed--to reconstruct diplomatic agreement with iran want also talk for moment about how disastrous last years have been--a period time during which united states has largely been out compliance with agreement jcpoa was signed united states european allies was entered into behalf coalition included russia china with iranian government was signed july 2015 within about months iaea was able verify iran had completed its obligations under nuclear agreement this included commitments would increase amount time iran needed acquire enough material for nuclear weapon from months--that was amount time would have taken them prior nuclear agreement--to least year more agreement reduced iran's stockpiles enriched uranium requiring ship 25,000 pounds out country iran committed dismantling removing two-thirds its centrifuges modified its heavy water reactor arak filled with concrete could never used again preventing iran from producing weapons-grade plutonium finally iran agreed provide unprecedented access its nuclear facilities its nuclear supply chain--not only sites knew about but also agreed adopt what are called additional protocols which allow iaea able request get access sites which might have some suspicion there was new prohibited nuclear research activity happening under this deal iran reduced its stockpile uranium percent kept its level uranium enrichment 3.67 percent significantly below levels would need make bomb jcpoa said got iranians reduce their number centrifuges from 20,000 6,000 this was world president trump inherited--the united states europe russia china united iran policy iran shutting down major elements their nuclear research program such were now more than year out from getting nuclear weapon made decision achieve nuclear weapon called breakout time time from which country decides wants nuclear weapon point which has nuclear weapon for iran went from months prior agreement over year after agreement but also lined united states europe china russia this unlikely alliance traditional adversaries least with respect russia china--so could then move iran's other malevolent behaviors critics deal said only pertains nuclear program but not only bad behavior iran engaged well president trump inherited united front unlikely allies then could utilized pressure iran make changes its ballistic missile program reduce its support for terrorist organizations proxy armies around region why secretary tillerson secretary mattis many other trump advisers encouraged him stay deal but didn't president trump tore deal announced country world was going pursue different strategy critics jcpoa said president obama shouldn't have entered into agreement critics said should have held out kept applying more more sanctions even europeans walked away means getting iran come table broader agreement would include its ballistic missile program its support for terrorists president obama believed was important get nuclear question off table but extent there was any silver lining president trump's decision allowed for years test theory opponents theory critics because president trump implemented strategy critics jcpoa wanted president obama employ donald trump imposed greater sanctions did without europeans demanded would only talk iranians came table everything fact set down piece paper secretary state mike pompeo gave iran list demands said will come table talk will consider releasing these sanctions talk about all your dangerous behaviors region--your nuclear program your ballistic missile program your support for terrorists president trump gave gift testing theory opponents know how story goes was spectacular failure was spectacular failure multiple respects first let's just talk about what happened iran's nuclear program may 2019 iran announces will longer observe jcpoa stockpile limit november last year stockpile enriched uranium enriched uranium gas--was roughly times what was during agreement july 2019 iran began enriching uranium 4.5 percent above 3.6 percent specified agreement january 2021 began enriching uranium percent april 2021 percent september 2019 iran announced would longer bound any research development limitations advanced centrifuges started research again november 2019 iran announced would start enriching uranium fordow 4.5 percent under jcpoa enrichment fordow was prohibited for years january last year iran was enriching uranium percent fordow november iran's parliament passed bill requiring country build new heavy water reactor arak allows them path plutonium once built reactor will capable producing enough plutonium annually for two nuclear weapons since february this year iran has been restricting iaea access its facilities longer complies with additional protocols ask for access site which think there new nuclear research activity being undertaken iran longer feels obligated grant access page s567 iran went breakout time months breakout time under agreement more than year today breakout time months--arguably less than breakout time prior deal but important also note during these last years none iran's other malevolent activities region have abated fact arguably have gotten worse iran continues support proxy armies syria yemen lebanon fact their connection with hezbollah lebanon with houthis yemen probably stronger today than was during jcpoa after president trump backed out jcpoa iran restarted attacks u.s troops now iran has been engaged permanent destabilizing activities iraq since outset war but during period time were jcpoa were not shooting directly u.s troops their proxy armies had stood down once were outside jcpoa those attacks started again fact one rocket was sent proxy army u.s staff base iraq could have killed 100 u.s troop members just narrowly missed iranians have undertaken attacks against saudis never would have contemplated while jcpoa was effect taking action against saudi oil facilities including high-profile attack against saudi aramco their proxy armies similarly are firing our friends gulf just last few months have seen increased level drone attacks missile attacks against saudi arabia uae from inside yemen one republican colleagues here this body claimed trump's iran policy had restored deterrence laughable proposition because did exactly opposite once got out agreement iran started their nuclear research program point stronger than was prior jcpoa some ways didn't stop any their other destabilizing activity got worse didn't come back table whole point critics obama policy was had just kept applying sanctions iran would come table everything trump tried didn't work iran didn't come table anything their actions region their actions against united states their nuclear research program just got more serious worse listen diplomacy not weakness news flash occasionally there are diplomatic agreements are best interests united states jcpoa was inarguably one them data tells clear story iran wasn't good actor during jcpoa were still engaged all sorts deleterious activity but donald trump inherited ability use coalition was built build jcpoa take other activity inherited nuclear research program which was controlled threw all away what interesting many our allies who were very skeptical jcpoa when was signed are now very supportive united states reentering tells see same story telling our gulf allies who were among most vocal opponents jcpoa 2014 2015 sent out joint statement urging mutual return full compliance jcpoa this was deal gulf nations opposed now support united states entering back into cavalcade israeli officials--former intelligence defense officials who can now feel freer speak about their personal views have been equally clear about need get back into this agreement tamir pardo was former director mossad for years directed mossad said what happened 2018 was tragedy was unforgiveable strategy fact israel pushed united states withdraw from agreement years early was strategic mistake amos yadlin former chief idf military intelligence unit job held for years said want honest what postponed iranian progress towards achieving nuclear weapons was nuclear agreement--and not military action iran closer now than have ever been before because very wrong policy withdrawing from agreement gadi eisenkot former idf chief staff said fact u.s withdrew 2018 from deal released iran from all restrictions inspections deal even there were holes agreement brought iran most advanced position today with regard its nuclear program many our friends region see need get back into this agreement status quo not acceptable now not going easy because there are elements iran's progress nuclear research are difficult not impossible undo given how much new research how many advanced centrifuges have built since president trump left agreement quite frankly there are some sanctions have applied iran since nuclear agreement aren't going release because told iranians world were going apply sanctions iran relevant their ballistic missile program their support for terrorist organizations did that--some them under president trump those aren't going away but important for biden administration see many sanctions trump put place during period time may have sounded good but had impact iranian behavior would put list sanctioning iranian revolutionary guard sanctioning supreme leader these aren't good people but those sanctions didn't change iran's behavior for better fact during period time their behavior got worse their nuclear research program became more advanced releasing those designations sanctions are required order make world safer get iran back into nuclear box then hope administration will give serious consideration hope administration understands vital importance getting back into this agreement being willing tough things order achieve new nuclear agreement with iranians iranians are going have make concessions well iranians are going have make some serious changes their current scope nuclear research but only way unlock sanctions relief for country badly needs there way for current president iran make good all promises made without sanctions relief but time essence time essence president biden promised restart diplomacy with iran make world safer place getting back into nuclear agreement this moment would urge administration take all smart steps necessary order prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapon making region world safer place yield floor presiding officer peters senator from connecticut order business--motion discharge murphy president yield back

spending bill told msnbc thursday united states can more for ukraine there were all sorts particular ways where administration yesterday said lot right things but just because pen was president biden's hand yesterday doesn't mean weapons are zelensky's hands today every point we're too slow feels like huge part administration's audience internal lawyers these offensive defensive legal-hairsplitting arguments sasse said senate floor thursday sasse argued spending bill wasn't really about ukrainian aid but whole bunch schlock ukrainian aid was little bit sugar larger medicine

trying have both ways maintaining their fidelity trump--who has praised russian president vladimir putin--and become zelensky fans same time voted exonerate trump for this specific reason which was withhold aid from zelensky here are again opposing aid zelensky schatz said now they're doing twice they're still acting they're defenders western-style democracy day before voting against bill sen

military 5.6 percent totaling 762 billion bill includes 2.7 percent pay increase for all active-duty troops several republicans were critical ukraine 2017 when trump began spreading conspiracy theory was ukraine--and not russia--that interfered with 2016 election two years later democrats accused trump leveraging military assistance oval office meeting with zelensky exchange for investigations biden his son hunter biden debunked theory alleging ukrainian interference election house impeached trump senate acquitted him charges abused powers his office obstructed congress all senate republicans except romney voted for acquittal sen mazie hirono d-hawaii told post thursday republican lawmakers arguing for more aid for ukraine days after voting against bill provide assistance height hypocrisy some them will find every way can criticize joe biden hirono said think it's more than ironic president continue support withheld aid ukraine for political purposes several these republicans who voted against bill criticized biden one republican pointed disconnect sen lindsey graham r-s.c who voted for bill advised his party stop sending mixed messages lamented spending bill with nearly billion for ukraine didn't pass senate 100-0 according politico thursday zelensky's chief staff andriy yermak tweeted was grateful united states which described ukraine's reliable partner biden does more for ukraine than any his predecessors yermak tweeted casey here subheadline thirty-one senate republicans voted last week against 1.5 trillion spending bill fund government increase u.s defense spending provide humanitarian military assistance ukraine recent days many them have clamored for more weapons aid goes from there not going read all obviously but chronicles hypocrisy just heard here today have heard for days now weeks now criticizing president when voted against all money--so all money from 13.6 billion will pay for javelin missiles are taking out russian tanks every day have for weeks--every penny out 13.6 could probably cut half terms what military assistance will let's say for sake argument probably half billion but whatever exact number money going help pay for lot more javelin missiles have been effective stinger systems have used antiaircraft systems are all going paid for ammunition body armor all other assistance are providing going made possible because most senate--50 democrats just republicans but are grateful for their support--voted for money have criticism about administration's policy are certainly entitled criticize administration but think your right criticize administration military assistance what are doing not doing military assistance when just voted against all money--all money yet over over again one watching well think american people get think know difference between someone who can justifiably criticize any administration foreign policy defense policy anything else but think should admit record didn't vote for money don't throw sand eyes people admit record didn't vote for money then lodge your criticism but course didn't many who voted wrong way now washington post also notes this article obviously was spending bill will allow fund government could talk about whether support funding government but here point was made article think lot people may have missed this funding bill also paid for pay increase for our troops u.s servicemembers got pay increase this bill yet would never know listening some folks who voted wrong way bill would think wasn't part this legislation think lot americans probably expect when are making argument against administration have right but think would lot more truthful were clear about where voted biggest ukraine spending measure recent history likely not just biggest ever for ukraine but biggest ever for lot countries help hope people across this chamber across country will make note contradiction because when voted against those dollars for ukraine were voting against not only people ukraine their ability fight this war obviously soldiers field but were voting against humanitarian support well will provide food medical care much else now way
