# Homework 3 Word Embeddings.

## Description
This project involves analyzing a corpus of text data using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project focuses on training word embeddings (Skip-gram and CBOW models) using the Gensim library, performing queries to explore semantic relationships, and analyzing biases in the embeddings. Additionally, it includes a classification task to compare the performance of a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model with a Word Embedding model. The project also explores bias detection using the WEAT framework and extends it to include age bias.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
- `gensim` (for training word embeddings)
- `nltk` (for text preprocessing)
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- `scikit-learn` (for classification tasks)
- `wefe` for WEAT applications

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```
pip install gensim nltk matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Notes:
#### The following pre-trained embeddding used in this homework is too large to upload. It can be downloaded at this link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

## How to Use
##### 1. Place the Python script in the desired directory.
##### 2. Organize your data, ensuring that your text data is stored in a structured format.
##### 3. Modify the script, updating file paths and directory names in the script to match your local setup
##### 4. Run the script from the command line with the following format:
##### python code.py

## Generative AI Use
##### Generative AI was used as outlined in the Report: homework3_report.pdf. It was also used partially in creating this README file.
