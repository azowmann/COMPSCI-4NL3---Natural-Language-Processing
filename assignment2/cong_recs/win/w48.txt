                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expunging the December 18, 2019, impeachment of President Donald John 
                                 Trump.

Whereas President Trump was wrongfully accused of misconduct in House Resolution 
        755, Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for 
        high crimes and misdemeanors, as demonstrated by the information 
        revealed in an unclassified FD-1023 FBI document: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the December 18, 2019, impeachment of President 
Donald John Trump is expunged, as if such Articles had never passed the 
full House of Representatives, as the facts and circumstances upon 
which such Articles were based did not meet the burden of proving the 
commission of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'', as set forth in section 
4 of article II of the Constitution.
