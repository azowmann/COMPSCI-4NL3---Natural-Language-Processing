                        HONORING GERRI McDANIEL

  (Mr. FRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a dear friend 
and dedicated public servant, Gerri McDaniel.
  Gerri had a fierce determination to better her community not just 
with her words but with her actions, as well.
  She was a resident of North Myrtle Beach for nearly 22 years, where 
she was active in her community, including the Horry County Republican 
Women's Club. She was a true pillar of the South Carolina conservative 
movement.
  In 2016, Gerri worked for President Donald Trump, helping to secure a 
historic victory.
  In 2020, she served as an elector to our electoral college, helping 
to assign our States' nine votes to President Donald Trump.
  Gerri's personality was infectious. She was an incredibly hard 
worker, and she had the unique ability to inspire others to work 
diligently for the conservative cause.
  Mr. Speaker, through all that she accomplished, one thing remained 
constant: her passion for improving the lives of South Carolina and our 
great country. Her conviction, her fearless leadership, and willingness 
to serve will no doubt leave a lasting legacy for all who knew her.
