                         PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the fall of the dictator 
Assad of Damascus is equivalent to the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
liberating central and eastern Europe, now leading to liberating the 
Middle East and North Africa.
  It is known that war criminal Putin and the regime in Tehran have 
lost a murderous puppet. War criminal Putin is trying to evacuate his 
bases. The Iranian regime is pivoting to support the Houthis in Yemen 
to attack American shipping. The terrorist regimes in Moscow and Iran 
are more vulnerable than ever.
  President Donald Trump wants to achieve peace through strength, 
working with our allies, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we 
know that he will be restoring the Abraham Accords, which will bring 
security for Israel and stability for the people of Syria and Lebanon, 
including the legitimate Governments of Georgia, Armenia, and 
Azerbaijan.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent, as warned by the FBI. Donald Trump will 
reinstitute existing laws to protect American families with peace 
through strength.
