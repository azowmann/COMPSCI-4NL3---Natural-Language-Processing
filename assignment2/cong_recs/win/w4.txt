                      AMERICAN PATRIOTISM RENEWED

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Donald Trump was 
sworn in as President of the United States, and there is a feeling of 
patriotic renewal among Americans.
  Don Feder with the Washington Times wrote an appropriate editorial 
yesterday titled, ``Trump's presidency heralds a patriotic renewal in 
America,'' stating: ``The most iconic image of the 2024 campaign came 
from the . . . Pennsylvania rally, where President-elect Donald Trump 
stood with blood on his face . . . shouting `Fight'. . . . The moment 
seems to symbolize the patriotic renewal thanks to the [now] 
President.''
  ``Mr. Trump is perfectly positioned to lead a patriotic renewal. 
While others talk about patriotism, he acts.''
  Mr. Trump understands that national security hinges on patriotic 
renewal. Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, a combat veteran, 
agrees.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators puts all Americans at risk of 
more 9/11 attacks imminent, as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstate 
and is reinstating existing laws to promote American families with 
peace through strength.
