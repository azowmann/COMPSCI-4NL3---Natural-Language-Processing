                 COUNTERING IRANIAN TERRORISTS IN IRAQ

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Iraq has been oppressed by 
kleptocrats who support Iranian terrorism. Sadly, Iran-backed militias, 
the Badr Organization, are part of the Iraqi Government, including the 
national security adviser. Badr was armed by terrorist Soleimani.
  Iran-backed militias in Iraq should be designated as terrorists, as 
Congressman Greg Steube and the Republican Study Committee have 
proposed. There must be sanctions on kleptocrat politicians complicit 
with Iran, such as former Prime Minister al-Maliki.
  Any aid to Iraq should be conditioned on not going to terrorists. 
Brett McGurk's policy of replacing ISIS with Iran has failed. President 
Donald Trump will reinstitute policies of maximum pressure on Iran, 
stopping Iraq's

purchase of Iranian electricity as he responds to the Tehran regime 
plot to assassinate him while they were shouting: ``Death to Israel, 
death to America.''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators puts all Americans at risk of 
more attacks as warned by the FBI. Trump is protecting American 
families.
  Americans opposed rigged elections in Georgia and support the 
legitimate President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia as protests build 
for free and fair elections in the nation of Georgia.
