                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the sermon 
given by the Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde at the National Prayer 
Service on January 21st, 2025, at the National Cathedral was a display 
      of political activism and condemning its distorted message.

Whereas the National Prayer Service is a longstanding tradition in which the 
        United States publicly affirms dependence upon God and prays for the 
        success of our President and Vice President;
Whereas, on January 21, 2025, President Donald J. Trump and Vice President J.D. 
        Vance took part in the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral 
        in Washington, DC; and
Whereas the Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, the bishop leading the inaugural 
        prayer service, used her position inappropriately, promoting political 
        bias instead of advocating the full counsel of biblical teaching: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
        the sermon given at the National Prayer Service on January 
        21st, 2025, at the National Cathedral was a display of 
        political activism; and
            (2) the House of Representatives condemns the Right 
        Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde's distorted message.
