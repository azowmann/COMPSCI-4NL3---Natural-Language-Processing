                           Inspectors General

  Mr. President, yesterday in the dark of night, President Trump fired 
at least 12 independent inspectors general at important Federal 
Agencies across the administration. This is a chilling purge, and it is 
a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration 
are taking far too often as he is becoming President. These dismissals 
are possibly in violation of Federal law, which requires Congress to 
have 30 days' notice of any intent to fire inspectors general.
  These firings are Donald Trump's way of telling us he is terrified of 
accountability and is hostile to facts and to transparency. Inspectors 
general can be vital for keeping the government honest. They are the 
ones who tell the truth and shed light on bad behavior, and we all know 
that there is nothing Donald Trump is more afraid of than someone who 
is independent. But President Trump, all too often, has an aversion to 
the truth, and when someone confronts him with truth and facts, he 
fires them and replaces them with loyalists.
  We are a fact-based society--or we have been. If we lose that, we 
lose the core of America. And Donald Trump's decision to fire 12 of the 
Federal Government's independent watchdogs is a glaring sign that it is 
a golden age for abuse in government and even corruption.
  When Government Agencies disobey the law in the next year and there 
is no independent IG to keep them in check, Donald Trump could well 
regret this action.
