                REPUBLICANS WILL ENFORCE BORDER SECURITY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, according to a report 
released by the House Committee on Homeland Security, more than 125,000 
illegal alien crossings took place in October alone, bringing the total 
number of illegal alien crossings since Biden-Harris of over 11 million 
nationwide, with Speaker   Mike Johnson warning of over 16 million 
illegal aliens.
  Dangerously, these catastrophic border crossing figures do not 
account for the illegal got-aways, including drug smugglers and 
identified terrorists who threaten every American family.
  Sadly, with the duplicitous policies of Biden-Harris, among those 
illegal transgressors are unaccompanied children who are suffering at 
the hands of cartel smugglers.
  Additionally, after meeting with President Donald Trump this weekend 
on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, I know he is committed to securing the borders 
and protecting families and making America great again.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent, as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstitute 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.
