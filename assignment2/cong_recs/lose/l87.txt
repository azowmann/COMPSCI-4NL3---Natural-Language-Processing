                         I. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY

    H.R. 6824, the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition 
Act, authorizes the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA) to carry out an annual cybersecurity competition 
for Federal civilian employees and members of the armed forces. 
This competition was created by Executive Order No. 13870 in 
2019, and the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition 
(President's Cup), with the goal to ``identify, challenge, and 
reward the United States Government's best cybersecurity 
practitioners and teams across offensive and defensive 
cybersecurity disciplines.''\1\ This bill grants CISA the 
necessary authorities to fully implement the competition, 
including by authorizing CISA to make specified expenditures to 
run the competition, and to directly provide cash prizes to the 
winning individuals and teams regardless of where they work in 
the Federal Government.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

              II. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION

    CISA launched the first President's Cup in 2019 as part of 
its effort to ``identify, challenge, and reward the best 
cybersecurity talent'' in the Federal workforce.\2\ The three-
round competition involves both individual and team challenges 
focusing on areas across the National Initiative for 
Cybersecurity Education Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.\3\ 
The 2021 competition was broken down into three categories: (a) 
incident response and forensic analysis (team); (b) incident 
response and forensic analysis (individual); and (c) 
exploitation analysis and vulnerability assessment 
(individual).\4\ Members of both the military and civilian 
federal workforce are eligible to participate in the 
competition.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Enthusiasm for the President's Cup has grown since the 
competition was first launched. Over 1,000 individuals and 200 
teams participated in the first year of the competition in 
2019. Participation grew to over 1,400 individuals and nearly 
250 teams in 2020, and, in 2021, nearly 2,000 federal employees 
competed.\6\ Despite this enthusiasm, lack of a formal 
authorization has prevented the program from achieving a 
critical objective rewarding the best cyber talent within the 
Federal Government. Notably, under current law and the 
program's establishment in Executive Order No. 13870, the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks the authority to 
provide cash prizes or an award ceremony to Federal workers who 
are employed outside of the Department. As such, CISA, as a 
component agency within DHS, can only encourage other Federal 
departments and agencies to provide rewards, or otherwise 
recognize, their employees who participate in and place in the 
competition.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    H.R. 6824 will specifically authorize the President's Cup 
Cybersecurity Competition in law in a manner that provides CISA 
with needed authority to award cash prizes and host ceremonies 
for the winners, rewarding their demonstrated cybersecurity 
skills, which in turn can serve as an important retention tool.

                        III. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

    Representative Luria (D-VA-2) introduced H.R. 6824, the 
President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act, on February 25, 
2022, with Representative Connolly (D-VA-11). The bill was 
referred to the House Committee on Homeland Security. 
Representative Garbarino (R-NY-2) joined the bill as a 
cosponsor on March 1, 2022. On March 2, 2022, the bill was 
marked up by the House Committee on Homeland Security favorably 
by a recorded vote of 33-0. On May 16, 2022, the House of 
Representatives passed the bill under a suspension of the rules 
by a vote of 386 to 31. The bill was referred to the Senate 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
    The Committee considered H.R. 6824 at a business meeting on 
September 28, 2022. During the business meeting, Senators 
Portman (R-OH) and Peters (D-MI) offered a modified substitute 
amendment that struck a provision pertaining to consultation on 
the design of the competition. The substitute amendment also 
clarified provisions regarding how funds for the competition 
are allowed to be spent, including an overall yearly award 
limit of $100,000. The Portman-Peters substitute amendment, as 
modified, was adopted by voice vote en bloc with Senators 
Peters, Carper, Hassan, Sinema, Rosen, Padilla, Ossoff, 
Portman, Johnson, Paul, Lankford, Romney, Scott, and Hawley 
present for the vote. The Committee ordered the bill, as 
amended, to be favorably reported by voice vote en bloc. 
Senators present for the vote were: Peters, Carper, Hassan, 
Sinema, Rosen, Padilla, Ossoff, Portman, Johnson, Paul, 
Lankford, Romney, Scott, and Hawley.
    Consistent with Committee Rule 3(G), the Committee reports 
the bill with a technical amendment by mutual agreement of the 
Chairman and Ranking Member.

        IV. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE BILL, AS REPORTED

Section. 1. Short title

    This section states that the Act may be cited as the 
``President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act''.

Section. 2. President's Cup cybersecurity competition

    Subsection (a) directs CISA to hold an annual cybersecurity 
competition of cybersecurity practitioners from across the 
Federal Government.
    Subsection (b) establishes that an individual must be a 
Federal civilian employee or member of the uniformed services 
to be eligible for the competition.
    Subsection (c) authorizes CISA to enter into a grant, 
contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement to 
administer the competition.
    Subsection (d) directs that the competition shall include 
cybersecurity skills outlined in the National Initiative for 
Cybersecurity Education Framework, individual or team events, 
categories demonstrating offensive and defensive cyber 
operations, and other related elements identified by CISA.
    Subsection (e) authorizes CISA to use appropriated funds or 
funds provided by other Federal agencies for specified expenses 
in order to carry out the competition. Specified expenses 
include advertising, marketing, and promoting the competition; 
meals for participants and organizers; promotional items; 
necessary expenses for honorary recognition of competition 
participants; and monetary and nonmonetary awards for 
participants.
    Subsection (f) authorizes CISA to provide awards up to 
$10,000 in value per award and DHS to provide awards up to 
$25,000 in value per award. It additionally establishes that 
any monetary award shall be in addition to the regular pay of 
the recipient and establishes an annual limit of $100,000 for 
the total value of awards provided by the competition.
    Subsection (g) directs CISA to provide an annual report to 
the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs and the House Committee on Homeland Security that 
provides a description of funds used for each competition, a 
description of expenditures of awards for each competition, 
information relating to participation of each competition, and 
information relating to lessons learned from each competition.

                   V. EVALUATION OF REGULATORY IMPACT

    Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 11(b) of rule 
XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has 
considered the regulatory impact of this bill and determined 
that the bill will have no regulatory impact within the meaning 
of the rules. The Committee agrees with the Congressional 
Budget Office's statement that the bill contains no 
intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs 
on state, local, or tribal governments.

             VI. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                  Washington, DC, October 17, 2022.
Hon. Gary C. Peters,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. 
        Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 6824, the 
President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Aldo 
Prosperi.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    
    

    H.R. 6824 would authorize the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to conduct an awards 
competition for the federal cybersecurity workforce. Under the 
bill, CISA would award financial prizes to federal employees 
who apply technical skills to solve real-world cybersecurity 
scenarios. The bill also would require CISA to report to the 
Congress on the effectiveness of the competition.
    CISA is already operating the President's Cup Cybersecurity 
Competition that would be required by H.R. 6824; thus, the bill 
would not impose any new requirements on the agency. CBO 
estimates that preparing and delivering the reports required by 
H.R. 6824 would cost less than $500,000 over the 2023-2027 
period; such spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    On April 27, 2022, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 
6824, the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act, as 
ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on 
March 2, 2022. The two bills are similar, and CBO's estimates 
of their costs are the same.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aldo Prosperi. 
The estimate was reviewed by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of 
Budget.

       VII. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED

    This legislation would make no change in existing law, 
within the meaning of clauses (a) and (b) of subparagraph 12 of 
rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, because this 
legislation would not repeal or amend any provision of current 
law.

                                  [all]
