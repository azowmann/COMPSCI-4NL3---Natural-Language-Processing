                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 17, 2022

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
recognize The Washington Times on their 40-year anniversary.
  Since its founding on May 17, 1982, The Washington Times has been a 
valuable resource by providing clear and informative articles on 
current events and national politics. I appreciate their continued 
service and look forward to reading their publication for many years to 
come.
  The following article, ``Washington Times' Only Agenda is the Agenda 
of its Readers,'' published May 16, 2022, by Christopher Dolan, 
President and Executive Editor, and Charles Hurt, Opinion Editor, 
encapsulates their years of journalistic accomplishments:

       Dear readers:
       For 40 years, The Washington Times has stood sentinel along 
     the banks of the Potomac River, shining a bright light into 
     all corners of the federal government.
       During Republican administrations and Democratic 
     administrations alike, the paper has been unflinching in 
     keeping its responsibility to inform readers and expose 
     government shenanigans.
       Long before ``fair and balanced'' became a battle cry and 
     the proliferation of websites spanning the political 
     spectrum, there was The Washington Times, beholden to no one 
     and no party.
       When Ronald Reagan stormed into Washington on a promise to 
     ``make America great again,'' The Washington Times was there 
     and chronicled the historic collapse of the Soviet Union.
       When George H.W. Bush won the Gulf War, only to later 
     stumble on his pledge of ``no new taxes,'' The Washington 
     Times was there.
       When a young, smooth-talking governor from Arkansas stunned 
     the political world, The Washington Times was there. And for 
     eight years, the paper produced award-winning political 
     coverage that culminated in President Clinton's impeachment 
     and investigations that to this day leave many questions 
     unanswered.
       During the epic 2000 presidential election recount in 
     Florida, The Times was there, counting chads and recording 
     every legal argument all the way to the Supreme Court.
       On Sept. 11, 2001, The Washington Times was there. And 
     never forgot.
       The Times stood watch from the triumphant march into 
     Baghdad to the bitter end of George W. Bush's presidency.
       The Times was there for the hopeful dawn of President 
     Obama's inauguration to the rejection of his presidency with 
     the election of Donald Trump.
       Of course, politics is the bread and butter of any 
     newspaper based in Washington. But The Times also has 
     invested unparalleled energies into covering the First 
     Amendment, religious freedom, American culture, gun rights 
     and social issues that many other newspaper shy from.
       The only agenda of The Washington Times is the agenda of 
     its readers. If it is important to you, it is important to 
     us. It has always been that way.
       Over the past four decades, tumultuous changes have wracked 
     the newspaper industry.
       Today, there is greater competition among news outlets--
     both in print and online--than ever before in human history. 
     The most vaunted and venerated publications must now compete 
     with any other outlet with a web address and a keyboard.
       But to this day, The Washington Times has never surrendered 
     its independence, its dedication to accuracy and its devotion 
     to the interests of its readers.
       Thank you for reading. We hope you will keep reading for 
     the next 40 years.
