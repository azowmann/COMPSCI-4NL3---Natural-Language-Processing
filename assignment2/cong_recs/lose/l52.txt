                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 20, 2022

 Mr. Durbin (for himself, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the Senate that violence and threats of 
 violence against the employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
               are unacceptable and should be condemned.

Whereas, pursuant to a judicially issued warrant, the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation (referred to in this preamble as ``FBI'') searched the 
        residence of former President Donald Trump (referred to in this preamble 
        as ``the former President'') on August 8, 2022, for classified and 
        national defense information records owned by the United States 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``the search'');
Whereas, in the days following the search, employees of the FBI and their 
        families have been subjected to threats of violence;
Whereas the threats to employees of the FBI and their families have been 
        inflamed by--

    (1) calls from members of Congress to ``destroy the FBI'' or ``defund 
the FBI'';

    (2) members of Congress comparing the execution of a lawful warrant by 
the FBI to the actions of the Nazi Gestapo; and

    (3) repeated attacks from the former President, who has called FBI 
officials, among other insults, ``vicious monsters'';

Whereas the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence 
        bulletin warning of a further increase in violent threats and acts of 
        violence against Federal law enforcement officials and facilities 
        following the search;
Whereas these threats include placing a ``dirty bomb'' outside of FBI 
        headquarters and calls for ``civil war'' and ``armed rebellion'';
Whereas the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have also ``observed the 
        personal identifying information of possible targets of violence, such 
        as home addresses and identification of family members, disseminated 
        online as additional targets'';
Whereas a man wearing body armor and armed with an AR-15 rifle and nail gun 
        attempted to breach the FBI Cincinnati Field Office on August 11, 2022;
Whereas a man was indicted on August 16, 2022, for threatening to murder 
        everyone at the FBI, from the Director, to agents, to the custodial 
        staff;
Whereas a man jumped a fence and threw rocks at the FBI Chicago Field Office on 
        August 25, 2022;
Whereas the continued leveling of threats and baseless attacks against the FBI 
        will increase the risk of injury or death that employees of the FBI 
        face; and
Whereas the employees of the FBI put their lives on the line every day to 
        protect the communities of the United States and uphold the rule of law: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns attacks and threats of violence against the 
        employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
            (2) condemns calls from members of Congress to ``destroy 
        the FBI'' and ``defund the FBI'';
            (3) urges public officials at every level of government to 
        reject and condemn political violence and the threat of 
        political violence, regardless of its motivation;
            (4) honors the dedicated service of the employees of the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation, including their work executing 
        lawful warrants; and
            (5) affirms that a founding principle of the United States 
        is that individuals settle differences through the political 
        process, not through the use or threat of violence.
