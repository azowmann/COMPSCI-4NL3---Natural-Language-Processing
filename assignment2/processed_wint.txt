suddenly charge million employees ran organizations with just few dozen employees tiny little budgets neither them were anything like defense department size scale what basis are supposed trust pete hegseth can manage not just largest employer country but one largest employers planet much like rest donald trump's cabinet main criteria for hegseth's nomination was his loyalty donald trump not saying loyalty president some sort disqualifier want your cabinet loyal but can't only thing also have good this not like couldn't have found maga world person was three-star four-star someone who had run big enterprise someone who had been governor someone who had done big things demonstrated could run big complex organizations what this this isn't about woke not woke foreign policy this about gosh this big job extent u.s senate personnel business provide our advice then our consent president providing with nominee very hard get yes someone who has just never run anything particularly large

police will forced''--``the military police will forced make choice yes there will some form civil war this guy want run defense department who couple years ago suggested democrats there might civil war not just hegseth trump acolyte getting plum job administration there plenty happening also has real understanding substantively job would doing leading department defense not just bureaucratic exercise day day out month after month are issuing billions dollars contracts making decisions are not all obvious super complex sensitive there are tradeoffs compromises have know how say building works your knowledge your experience really matter here which why was alarming wasn't able name single member asean when asked colleague senator tammy duckworth wasn't gotcha question pretty basic stuff asean which stands for association southeastern asian nations essential part strategy indo-pacific these are key partners defense secretary directly engages with hegseth didn't even know first thing about them named bunch countries don't even belong organization page s346 later when was asked senator slotkin whether would carry out illegal order from donald trump like using military against civilians refused give straight answer there are lot close calls when are defense secretary but whether not turn military public even are democrats not close call simple wouldn't will not carry out illegal order united states military not existence for purpose carrying out orders against united states citizens exercising their constitutional rights leading our armed forces not part-time gig

without objection ordered mrs murray president realize some republicans were hoping would cut this process short but have problem coming floor having lengthy discussion about hegseth's nomination defense secretary eager talk about only person who doesn't seem want talk about hegseth nomination actually hegseth himself because have been trying for weeks schedule meeting with hegseth prior his confirmation vote genuinely want chance ask him directly about concerns with his character fitness yes but also about serious challenges facing our nation whether competition with china aggression from russia vice chair senate appropriations committee help write bill funds defense department every year bill only passes with bipartisan support don't think asking lot able meet with person nominated lead department have had opportunity meet with president trump's cabinet nominees look forward meeting with more before are confirmed senate conducting these meetings absolute bare minimum given role each senator constituents represent but hegseth refused meet with has refused meet with many democratic colleagues think most americans would agree shouldn't get job decide can skip job interview every nominee--every nominee should willing meet with senators regardless their party answer basic questions about how would approach their role confirmed honestly beneath dignity role aspires for hegseth refuse meet one-on-one with most democrats what afraid are questions have ask really hard mean hegseth afraid how going stand china meeting with members both sides isn't just some formality are confirmed part job this serious concern one many concerns have now with hegseth's qualifications his positions his character let's perfectly clear about stakes here are talking about who will put command most powerful military world there nothing hegseth's resume remotely suggests has experience for role have deep appreciation for his service our country but let's not kid ourselves here don't see how being fox host prepares lead million servicemembers civilians don't see how bankrupting veterans nonprofit through wasteful spending qualifies manage budget nearly 900 billion moreover really truly have sense what his understanding military policy what his strategic priorities would thanks senator duckworth know someone who can't name single country asean ignorance alarming senators only had minutes during his confirmation hearing ask questions many asked questions knew our republican colleagues would not regarding hegseth's questionable character fitness--important questions absolutely but because had spend much time understanding even could this job most basic level had precious little time ask him about how would his job how would pete hegseth ensure our servicemembers their families have resources need home abroad how does plan reduce costs development times for key military capabilities are critical our national security how would invest our defense industrial base public shipyards like one home state washington how does view pacing threat indo-pacific how would work with our partners our allies prepare for potential conflict does have any thoughts all this just not serious candidate who has thoughtful positions challenges face know what position serious about what has stated over over again i'm straight just saying should not have women combat roles said last november need moms but not military especially combat units infuriating disqualifying don't have try very hard imagine how kind condescending attitude will over with our women uniform after decades comments like this--denigrating role women military ways simply not square with reality hegseth's recent about-face this topic just not convincing has also made clear has little regard for geneva conventions maybe this bit old-fashioned but think should have secretary defense who firmly against war crimes not one who has spoken favor torture like waterboarding favor people convicted war crimes questioned whether should follow geneva conventions let's not forget addition having real qualifications many alarming positions hegseth has many red flags raise serious concerns about his character his conduct there report his management team pursued women his staff there report took his employees strip club got drunk there report got drunk uniform had carried out strip club there report chanted kill all muslims while was drunk beyond reporting there are police records backing account woman who told nurse may have been drugged then raped pete hegseth couldn't hear from woman because hegseth reached financial settlement has now threatened sue her for speaking out almost didn't hear about incident all since didn't even disclose when was vetted but there are other people have now heard from know his mother once wrote her son directly criticizing him abuser women know his former sister-in-law signed affidavit has shared saw hegseth drink excess understood his ex-wife feared for her safety with him know same ex-wife told fbi drinks more than doesn't awful lot smoke for ignoring fire there absolutely world where someone who has history running debts nonprofits should responsible for overseeing half our discretionary spending there world where someone with history failing page s347 address his irresponsible alcohol use should given one most stressful jobs imaginable should making life-and-death decisions daily hourly basis there world where should have predator running department defense responsible for well-being millions women men uniform don't get how complicated president let just end this there world where person charge our military should see his fellow americans enemy but hegseth has made clear his view regarding democrats republicans has written--and this him other side--the left--is not our friend are not esteemed colleagues nor mere political opponents are foes either agree nothing else especially dark view our country our military uniforms not say democrat not say republican just don't cannot effective commander your people don't trust but how are troops supposed trust keep them safe combat think half nation enemy how are muslim servicemembers supposed trust think their religion threat our country how are women servicemembers supposed trust think should home don't have answer maybe hegseth doesn't either maybe why won't meet with then again maybe because thinks his foe because democrat maybe doesn't think should have say military issues because woman president have say say someone like hegseth

agree baby born alive after attempted abortion must protected yet fully expect later today democratic colleagues will vote this legislation will vote against protection for living breathing newborn baby simply because child has been born alive after attempted abortion now why are going vote like after all think most democrats would still claim oppose infanticide even moral line times appears slipping yet democrats are going vote against legislation provide appropriate medical care living breathing newborn children sure will offer some vague justifications for their opposition like keeping decision between woman her doctor even when decision are talking about denying child appropriate medical care but think safe say what all boils down this democrats will oppose legislation provide appropriate medical care newborn children who survive abortions because are afraid are afraid recognize humanity living breathing born baby abortion clinic might end pointing humanity unborn baby abortion clinic what this boils down democrats are afraid recognizing humanity newly born child will inadvertently point humanity unborn child understand where are coming from after all once recognize humanity newly born baby gets little harder say child wasn't human just few minutes ago simply because wasn't yet born because there nothing more important democrats than abortion will vote against legislation provide appropriate medical care babies born alive abortion clinic just case such law ends jeopardizing their cherished right abortion think this should make democrats--frankly should make all us--think when supposed right kill unborn babies starts motivating vote against protections for born babies perhaps should start questioning whole abortion project because there one thing

citizens presiding officer senator from oklahoma lankford president for past minutes colleagues have come this floor able talk about bill coming soon will actually vote bottom this hour bill have talked about for several years has been debated some about what happens child survives botched abortion now going talk about little bit have got some other colleagues who are going step moment then going talk little bit more about this because this seems incredibly misunderstood issue interesting most often talk about botched medical procedure--that there botched medical procedure someone dies this literally opposite--that there was botched medical procedure someone lives whole debate botched medical procedure was supposed take life child ends actually delivering child now have living breathing child crying table fully viable question what now yesterday democratic colleagues spent hour floor saying child should die disagree all our conversations about abortion--and have various opinions this room quite frankly across country have various opinions about when child child some people believe child child when have unique dna different than mom different than dad conception has occurred cell division has happened quite frankly how science defines life unique replicating cell division some people believe child some people say well not child until there heartbeat some people would say well not child until there actually developed nervous system some people would say not child until roe standard hear very often--that viable child could survive outside womb which about weeks gestation have lot colleagues who will say well want back roe standard but have yet have colleague come say with abortion after delivery what are talking about this now incredibly small group are discussing here but are talking about common-ground issue why wouldn't this common-ground issue earlier this week found common-ground issue issue very contentious this body about immigration have had wide variety opinions about how enforcement for immigration but found area say person has crossed border committed multiple crimes united states should detained found bipartisan agreement don't agree everything but least agreed one realize first bill like have passed decades--that has actually passed going signed president are making law issue where found simple common ground small niche issue related immigration well this small niche issue very contentious issue about abortion--what when child actually delivered instead destroyed womb viable child now some democratic colleagues have said this never happens well would love introduce friend mine named melissa ohden when melissa ohden's mom was years old was compelled her family have abortion had abortion--her mom did--and delivered child child was delivered then literally baby was set aside into medical waste procedure hospital nurse then few minutes later was cleaning after procedure noticed medical waste was crying was breathing nurse literally scooped this child took child from room emergency room where survived folks early said would blind would have major heart condition would have everything else wish could meet melissa amazing fully healthy fact was years later learned her adopted mom had adopted her because her birth mom literally didn't know still existed her birth mom was never told actually abortion didn't work child survived have since reconnected melissa her birth mom--her birth mom with deep regret thinking about this beautiful child front her life was almost destroyed fact was planned destroyed listen this not just academic issue this real again rare but question what those rare situations how track this how engage would ask any american there child lying table operating room crying what then don't know many americans who would say kill but here what happens botched abortion america right now when child actually delivered rather than destroyed womb when literally there was medical mistake didn't take life child but instead delivered child into life--when occurs current practice everyone kind backs away allows child die table exposure because against american law every single state take life child but everybody just steps back watches child die democratic colleagues came floor yesterday said this already illegal why are even discussing this this already illegal can't have infanticide america would say correct already illegal infanticide but what still allowed tiny little loophole abortion was botched everyone can just back away watch child die not have give child medical care quite loophole painful for even have have this conversation nation like ours all things could talk about right now why even have discuss what with child table operating room crying why this even conversation are bringing bill floor today able fix this this bill talked about multiple times this body but should absolute easiest common-ground piece face which standing operating room would look crying child would say ignore wouldn't say there shouldn't say here will back few moments president have other colleagues who want able speak this issue but have some facts myth want side side with some democratic colleagues who came able share their perspective this want able lay some things side side say what this bill actually does not what myth what actually being told about meantime would encourage members this body able look friend melissa ohden look her online want see her beautiful picture read her story for yourself because not only one with same story just one many has story just not many are willing able step out speak knowing their life was intended taken though today are still smiling talking about value every single life page s293 yield floor presiding officer senior senator from louisiana cassidy president bill are discussing today should really straightforward child who survives failed abortion attempt should receive lifesaving medical care are talking about not abstraction are talking about living breathing person--a little girl little boy--who comes into world after failed abortion shouldn't just put side allowed die deserve care need survive imagine was week later were going home from hospital there was car wreck would rush them hospital would everything help child survive once child born should straightforward should helping child survive there difference value dignity child--of person--as whether not were originally wanted not once are born have natural right which all have discussed our declaration independence our right life liberty physician was trained take best care patient regardless circumstances brought them before may have been someone society didn't particularly care for didn't matter patient going everything possibly can help patient survive thrive should ethic should enshrine into law but president little struck democratic colleagues offer variety excuses justify opposing this bill this kind like inconvenient truth botched abortions happen now democratic colleagues refuse acknowledge infanticide--withholding care baby who born alive--is horrific wrong but know failed abortions occur senate help committee--health education labor pensions--heard powerful testimony last year from melissa ohden melissa survived abortion would have been left die not for courageous nicu nurse--a neonatal intensive care unit nurse life could have been wasted now used advocate for those who not have voice innocent children should not have hope there nicu nurse like melissa's who will everything possible save their life president this vote support basic human decency every child deserves have chance live urge colleagues believe prayer pray don't believe prayer look declaration independence

issue choice women's rights women's health there greater spokesperson than thank her will hear from her shortly now today's vote senate republicans so-called born-alive bill makes one thing very clear under president trump will golden age but for extreme anti-choice movement bill very definition pernicious attacks women's healthcare using false narratives outright fear-mongering adds more legal risks for doctors something already illegal much hard-right's anti-choice agenda pushed frankly people who have little understanding what women through when are pregnant scenario targeted this bill one most heartbreaking moments woman could ever encounter agonizing choice having end care when serious rare complications arise pregnancy moment agony this bill cruelly substitutes judgment qualified medical professionals wishes millions families allows ultraright ideology dictate what women should supported trusted when faced with serious pregnancy complications this when male politicians should step support women not use them political footballs this bill heartlessly does anything this bill metaphor for what come emboldened extremist anti-choice resurgence further right than american people are even than most republicans are remember when republicans said this issue would left states both president trump our republican colleagues said don't worry are going leave this states not what this bill does doesn't leave states think are going see this over over again where promises made during campaign are just broken this one days after donald trump inaugurated president longer left states any promise people made are going leave things women their doctors out window with this bill again are going see repeated over over again--not left states imposed some politicians here washington women across america not respecting rights women their doctors their families here message republican colleagues instead attacking reproductive care today would great day for senate republicans something lower cost groceries prescription drugs helping americans buy home would also great day for senate republicans trust women leave their healthcare choices them but are not doing yield floor presiding officer senator from washington mrs murray president earlier this week friend champion for reproductive rights cecile richards helped countless women changed conversation around women's health abortion know were here would say fight continues very clear given what republicans are choosing focus today all bills could voting on--lowering healthcare costs expanding childcare helping our families--it absolute disgrace republicans are spending their very first week power attacking women criminalizing doctors lying about abortion not going let anyone perpetuate disgusting lies about people who have abortions providers who care for them this not how abortion works republicans know all babies are already protected under law regardless circumstance their birth doctors already have legal obligation provide appropriate medical care already know this sham bill from republicans not going anywhere have been here before last time voted down this bill actually spoke about something republicans refuse acknowledge this debate struggles--the struggles pregnant woman who has received tragic news her baby had fatal medical condition would not able survive who are able make choice was right for their family but now here are already hearing stories women who were denied choice now extreme republican abortion bans can imagine what like for months pregnant with baby know will not survive getting questions comments like this your first child are excited know what like woman fight back tears try decide whether nod politely somehow explain actually your world falling apart--i can't imagine but happens--and all while know have through this against your will because some politician decided knew better than your family your doctor page s294 now republicans have bill today take issue nationwide what are voting their top priority now trump office shame them urge colleagues vote against this bill yield floor presiding officer senator from oklahoma lankford president just few moments this body will vote bill actually doesn't limit abortion all doesn't slow down one abortion doesn't stop one woman from choosing have abortion doesn't have nationwide ban abortion fact this bill about what happens after abortion what unique about this bill asking pretty simple question seems like would common ground issue for there this case medical mistake didn't take life normally think about medical mistake takes life but this case there was medical mistake actually protected life what happens this doesn't limit one single abortion america though many people this body know well enough know would love protect more children america this bill just asks simple question abortion botched child delivered instead destroyed womb child alive viable table what happens next current medical practice everyone room just backs away allow child die table don't think what most americans would want think most americans would say hey have got boundaries issue abortion definitely fully born boundary now has been interesting have listened debate yesterday today from democratic colleagues many them friends have real disagreement this this not extreme--as have heard described extreme rightwing proposal about abortion just don't think pulled 100 people off street said hey child alive screaming table after birth what think should bet 100 out 100 them would say should probably give them medical care just don't think extreme out main thought america think just who americans are are compassionate people when see baby look their face don't say ignore them say let's provide some care have heard some colleagues say should respect rights women this way think one those women should little girl born who lying table right there crying think should get some compassion respect well because decision being made this point about what not theory several colleagues yesterday have used terms during this debate like this myth-based fearmongering was favorite one republicans are talking about stories not happen was also expressed another one colleagues this one was just little more blunt one colleagues just came floor said republicans are lying well here what really happened let give status this doesn't happen very often all thankfully this rare but cdc does some tracking there are quite frankly only eight states america actually keep track this there botched abortion child actually delivered fully alive there are only eight states most states say don't fact what interesting tried able track which states actually keep track this have some kind instruction what healthcare few states many states don't fact some states like minnesota literally voted recently used track reporting but don't even want know anymore this occurs don't tell occurs few states just actually track this over several year period there were 277 cases like this where child was actually delivered was alive after botched abortion now again not many but know from eight states short time period occurring again back basic question what want about want just ignore have thought about what should happen child some colleagues have said this only occurs there pregnancy complication child was already going die there was fatal medical condition was actually occurring well actually not true this bill this bill about viable child was delivered late term now table alive have also heard this going have this massive overreach for doctors are going oppressed are going afraid practice this actually bill pretty clear this this still gives doctor ability use his her professional judgment care would normally provided child born doctor may look say this child not going make still professional judgment there may have professional judgment child will make have mentioned this floor before there are adults walking around today survived abortion like melissa ohden other folks know personally this not something just never occurs doesn't limit abortion doesn't restrict doctors actually does happen contrary what some colleagues have said this never happens actually does happen this have had colleagues have said infanticide already illegal this unnecessary let's move this unnecessary except have also established issue yes taking life child table literally once child table crying can't reach down take life child kermit gosnell horrific stuff but just allowing them slowly die still protected not there one colleagues came this floor made this statement center this debate whether believe premise from declaration independence all are created equal freedom belongs everyone women deserve treated equal citizens actually couldn't agree more with colleague because same declaration independence right next statement about everyone being created equal also includes simple little comment says life liberty pursuit happiness our question this particular bill when child born crying table does have opportunity for life liberty pursuit happiness not all this bill does this bill should simple process say this not who are americans americans respect opportunity for life for child fully delivered then determine what are going just because baby can't defend herself doesn't mean disposable means vulnerable means nation should determine what are going with life most vulnerable encourage yes vote this this should bipartisan conversation where speak from this body for those who

nomination peter hegseth kaine president rise member armed services committee discuss nomination pete hegseth our nation's secretary defense let make two preliminary comments first philosophy about voting nominees give deference president who has been elected who has mandate carries with mandate assemble leadership team executive positions always begin with any president democrat republican with beginning standpoint should able assemble team unless there are significant challenges with nominee second want say part work have done examining this nominee did review his military record express respect for military record pete hegseth's service military review those pentagon records suggested served very honorable way want acknowledge yet rise oppose nomination urge colleagues oppose least take time really understand gravity behavioral challenges have been demonstrated hegseth during his career have multiple problems with this nominee for this position this position secretary defense position view many virginians view most important cabinet post let review reasons for opposition first hegseth's record one erratic unprofessional troubling behavior hegseth was married twice before was married his current wife his third wife first two marriages there were allegations both serious multiple infidelities asked him hearing when appeared before whether took oath fidelity his spouses course did same way secretary defense will take oath uphold constitution united states but evidence was before public record was before very very troubling hegseth's first marriage there were public reports was unfaithful his wife least five different times with multiple other people never rebutted because wouldn't meet with members committee democratic side didn't get chance talk about closed setting which would have been most important his second marriage was married while married fathered child woman who would become his third wife august 2017 was still married wife cheated her with woman who would bear his child become wife but very shocking way within months after birth this child was republican political event hotel monterey cheated both his second wife mother his newborn incident led sexual assault criminal investigation this behavior--look people are people people make mistakes but first marriage breaking over serial infidelity then second marriage also bedeviled serial infidelity something has call questions about individual's judgment hegseth has been leader two nonprofit organizations are veterans service organizations one organizations concerned veterans for america during time was ceo employee organization wrote scathing report about hegseth's creating toxic work culture this environment where impairment alcohol was not only exhibited him but tolerated others where there was significant creation toxic work environment for women employees committee members have had access report was not done because was nominated for secretary defense this was report was done employees given leaders this organization time--now nearly years ago--with about names employees individuals organization with knowledge facts recitation event after event after event where people were treated unfairly women were made feel were second class organization alcohol abuse was common workplace events referenced sexual assault claim monterey will call undisclosed sexual assault claim because hegseth never told trump transition team about this event when was being considered vetted secretary defense again married wife has now fathered child woman being unfaithful wedding within months after fathering child goes event monterey gets woman event into his hotel room has sex with her claims was drugged raped filed criminal complaint about with local law enforcement within days after event admits event says was consensual--not sexual assault rape but consensual--but acknowledges occurred what then happened survivor went local law enforcement filed sexual assault claim claim was investigated over period time prosecutor ultimately decided not pursue criminal charges against hegseth but there was civil claim well later led settlement with victim payment cash victim entrance into nondisclosure agreement with victim none this was disclosed trump team were examining hegseth secretary defense didn't disclose event didn't disclose criminal sexual assault claim didn't disclose fact investigation didn't disclose civil claim didn't disclose settlement didn't disclose cash payment didn't disclose nondisclosure agreement hid all from trump transition team when asked him why didn't really have answer told him page s296 know reason why were worried told them about this would not nominate secretary defense relationship between secretary defense president very important relationship demands complete candor there always some challenge there always something pentagon might going wrong hegseth demonstrated very critical moment would not let president-elect know about this fact because wanted advance himself worried was candid would cause problems for him don't want secretary defense who unwilling candid with commander chief has already demonstrated grave reason doubt whether will candid his refusing disclose reality this sexual assault allegation monterey affidavit was filed yesterday one danielle hegseth former sister-in-law nominee revealing publicly facts suggesting spousal abuse hegseth's second marriage don't know danielle hegseth haven't talked her was not aware allegation but didn't surprise anyone committee who had reviewed record why not because there are already facts record raising this very question fact asked hegseth about armed services committee during his second divorce his own mother wrote him letter saying essentially are serial abuser women including your own two wives need look mirror get some help figure this out his mother even used phrase neither nor y''--the names first two wives--``deserved treatment have received your hand all committee members had access before hearing all them what extraordinary letter--your mother writing letter saying are serial abuser women who needs look mirror get help saying two wives have abused not deserve treatment have received your hand allegation from danielle hegseth yesterday reporting her observations hegseth's behavior particular abuse her sister-in-law have given some credence this committee have avoid rush may regret found very unusual when asked hegseth hearing sexual assault would disqualifying secretary defense would not agree with spousal abuse would disqualifying secretary defense would not agree with being impaired alcohol while job would disqualifying secretary defense would not agree with these are not hard questions are clearly disqualifying behaviors fact would not agree were disqualifying behaviors suggested was watching testimony evinced little bit guilty conscience why would want agree have concerns about own behavior what has been hegseth's response allegations infidelity demonstrating poor judgment creation toxic work culture alcohol impairment while work this undisclosed sexual assault claim allegations spousal abuse what has his response been his response has been twofold complete denial--complete denial with exception acknowledging yes did cheat his wife mother newborn child monterey september 2017 has denied everything else even though record replete with specific instances specific times with specific individuals attesting these behaviors his other defense claim all this--all it--is anonymous smear--an anonymous smear let tell colleagues this anything but anonymous when your own mother writes letter saying are serial abuser women including your two wives don't deserve treatment have received your hand not anonymous report whistleblower concerned veterans for america organization decade ago anything but anonymous report listed--i counted them--incidents involving named individuals who had been either participating victimized witnessing aware incidents described document this not anonymous danielle hegseth's public affidavit not anonymous one thing will acknowledge anonymous space this number individuals who have come forth shared with other members committee their own firsthand knowledge similar events but said can't use name because afraid afraid what hegseth would afraid what president might had someone say when said needn't afraid easy for say easy for say building u.s capitol where work could attacked people when was well fortified secure what chance would have someone didn't like fact publicly criticized this nominee yes there are some who are speaking who are asking for anonymity have asked for should provided but there are many who have spoken either directly via affidavit records are available all committee members all senators who are anything but anonymous would urge colleagues not just armed services committee members read documents are available before cast your vote set your feet stone about nominee should see these documents want back one point made think telling hegseth's refusal disclose these facts trump transition team one thing not disclose them committee one thing refuse meet with committee--i will get second--but when president-elect who going commander chief vetting for most important cabinet position united states know have been charged with sexual assault led criminal investigation civil settlement cash payment nondisclosure agreement choose not reveal president view itself should disqualifying level disrespect shows for president-elect view should disqualifying let conclude with couple other points main point pattern behavior which should make anyone wary vote for hegseth for secretary defense but there are couple other points want mention hegseth think sort set very unfortunate precedent have been armed services committee have sat side side with colleague senator king committee since came senate january 2013 have now participated confirmation hearings for about five secretaries defense both democratic republican nominees hegseth only one who refused meet with democratic members committee save for chairman jack reed met with republican committee members but all were trying set meetings with him has been our norm could talk him about these issues ask him questions privately our office some these matters are frankly probably better for private discussion than public discussion but stiff-armed every one except for jack reed some ways maybe not surprise this individual who has written books articles where said democrats are evil democrats are adversary but are nominated secretary defense pentagon nonpolitical military civilian military should not politicized begin job saying needn't even sit down pay respective meeting with democratic senators what about democrats who serve military independents libertarians people who don't share hegseth's party affiliation what does say men women who work for our military when wouldn't even pay respect paid every predecessor when would meet with senators both parties before hearing page s297 was very disturbed other day when had committee hearing forward hegseth's nomination republican majority asked for waiver forward faster than rules allow waiver can granted committee votes one colleagues senator warner said republicans wait are asking waive normal rules don't want waive normal rules speed this along wouldn't even meet with thought was pretty compelling argument understand hegseth has respect for senators this body who are democrats one thing but would expect senate colleagues have some respect for have served with members this committee republican side some have been there entire years have been there didn't think would tolerate nominee stiff-arming there was democratic nominee for secretary defense who refused meet with republican members committee would raise heck about publicly committee threaten block nominee until met with republican members committee know senator king would same thing democrats would same thing would not tolerate nominee stiff-arming one side dais refusing meet with wouldn't tolerate was shocked republican colleagues closed meeting days ago demonstrated are just fine with this favorite committee senate work very cooperatively bipartisan way republican colleagues are perfectly fine with being disrespected because happen democrats who our citizens elected serve u.s senate very very shocking one other point want bring have revealed much material record other senators can view for themselves but have say looking investigation record which was compiled largely fbi was very very weak fbi went out investigation hegseth report was made available chair ranking member not members committee haven't seen report but have been able ask questions chair ranking about allegations have walked through which are largely public record fbi didn't even interview wives even after mother's letter had said are serial abuser women including your two wives fbi did not even out interview wives why not mean was investigation just like box-checking exercise number when heard sort raised hell about like are going investigation talk people who know nominee best then two wives are people ought talk embarrassed fbi after fact went out did very cursory discussion with one wives again have not seen material have not been allowed see should itself shock colleagues public but have confirmed speaking about with ranking chair interview with wife was very cursory covered one set topics but left many questions have raised here completely unanswered unaddressed nominee secretary defense going have enormous power over physical safety americans over peace war diplomacy world aren't senators exercising our advice consent role entitled background investigation meaningful searching comprehensive are supposed just given some half work product say great let's just rush confirm somebody shouldn't confirming person insufficient background check didn't have all these acknowledged problems are part public record but when are part public record when fbi finds out wow didn't tell transition team about sexual assault claim investigation should thorough not mediocre cursory going conclude just say this may not last time appear floor speak this nomination but for now request colleagues simple one why rush why rush why would rush put through nomination for position this importance frayed with much baggage much evidence glaring character judgment errors want have egg our face want rush have this blow later want rush have other witnesses come out danielle hegseth did yesterday what senate's advice consent process mandated constitution for very important reason has come to--a cursory investigation doesn't get underlying facts even when are sitting right out there before are going rush confirm someone for what reason sit down will just conclude with question why rush this let's take time when cast vote confirmation cast with confidence have complete information about man who has been nominated our secretary defense yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll bill clerk called roll cantwell president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered tiktok cantwell president rise today speak about tiktok which think all people here know have been having lot attention about--a lot debate lot discussion lot action supreme court but now think people are getting little clouded path forward want clear last year u.s congress passed law requiring bytedance sell tiktok law requires sale shut down all government back doors chinese attempts them influence algorithms could affect u.s citizens u.s military requires sale end chinese government's influence over tiktok's content recommendation algorithms this law also requires data sharing with chinese government must end was glad see u.s court appeals for district columbia u.s supreme court unanimously upheld law why because asked them whether congress had ability act this national interest pass this law upheld congress courts acted for reason--to address real national security threats our country american people when president trump issued his executive order recognized tiktok collected vast amounts data u.s citizens house resolution res 1051 introduced leadership house select committee china congressman gallagher congressman krishnamoorthi sets out threat citing from u.s government agencies from u.s government officials points out department commerce found out china building massive database american personal information understand who target for

compromise americans personal devices commander u.s cyber command director national security agency testified one-third adult population receives their news from tiktok one-sixth american children use every day added tiktok provides national platform for information operations for surveillance page s298 further information director cia william burns indicated bytedance can use private data american tiktok users shape tiktok content suit interests chinese government now this was most important related rutgers university report which found tiktok amplifies demotes content based interests chinese government surprise could have influence demote promote whatever want promote rutgers report found--oh surprisingly--that issues hong kong tiananmen square didn't quite have same level oomph tiktok did instagram meaning those posts about those subjects were somehow not voluminous found foreign policy issues disfavored china russia also had fewer hashtags tiktok issues such pro-ukraine stance pro-israel stance fact one instance there were 8,000 times more tiananmen square hashtags instagram than tiktok this was all supposed about just generous posting individuals posting content why would one platform have even with volume different platforms 8,000 times more hashtags well sure chinese government doesn't like talk about tiananmen square pretty sure don't like talk about uighurs genocide other issues there were 750 times more pro-ukraine hashtags instagram than tiktok deputy national security adviser also pointed out bytedance has used tiktok surveil u.s journalists identify retaliate against potential sources now this concern united states wouldn't let chinese government own abc nbc why are allowing them influence source information about news particularly when are retaliating against journalists studies from cornell university university vermont found tiktok promotes toxic diet culture among teens young adults including pro-anorexia content can't think anything more disgusting identifying teens--which can see rutgers report teen identified all concerned about these issues next thing get massive amount data thrown onto them about being pro-anorexia which again just promoting younger people having less faith themselves their body image both u.s house u.s senate received classified briefings this national security threat what should moving forward prominent leaders both sides aisle have called out this threat indicating need something move forward one colleague senator cotton senate intelligence committee has been quite clear said floor last week tiktok harvests vast trove user data including name age email address phone number credit card number facial features voiceprints keystrokes photos videos viewing habits this data can make users susceptible manipulation even blackmail not only today but also years from now when users may have become influential persons military intelligence community business media other walks life agree with senator cotton this issue where this kind collection information u.s citizens drives opportunities for people manipulate particularly area military senators members congress want work with president trump tries end what chinese overinfluence such important national security threat good news technology advancing particularly advancing very rapidly right now are starting see technology hope finally giving ability take some this control back with algorithms ourselves--as individuals u.s citizens maybe have heard buzz around agentic here what means plain language now will control algorithms billionaires foreign governments have been using control agentic lets turn tables them will now use take massive amounts information from internet from all sources then apply filters want see choose for ourselves only get information want see not what somebody else wants with our information hope president considering these issues will look this software solution don't know joint venture with chinese going rectify this issue about algorithms can't continue own influence this process but u.s innovation u.s ownership can drive forward can drive better experience for our young people believe this issue about young people our youngest citizens america shouldn't source information--targeted them--to undermine them basically create insecurities them promote ideas not believe united states

made our first order business take laken riley act this bill small but critical step for resolving biden border crisis--the first many might add laken riley act not complicated bill says illegal immigrant involved theft-related crime must detained means someone who country illegally--in other words who has already broken our laws--commits robbery will detained this bill had already been law illegal immigrant who killed laken riley would not have been streets day murdered her when was cited for shoplifting less than months before day would have been detained laken riley might still alive today what are trying here prevent another tragedy unfortunately seems even simple straightforward bill detain criminal illegal immigrants too much for some left some our democratic colleagues have spent week searching for reason--any reason--to justify voting against this bill for starters have heard this bill would cover too many illegal immigrants admission there are too many individuals our streets who have committed crime after coming into country illegally argument for this bill not against have also heard immigration customs enforcement lacks detention capacity for number individuals this bill will require detained well resources are scarce answer provide those resources answer not let criminals continue walk our streets republicans believe keeping criminal illegal aliens off our street good investment are currently working bill will provide ice with additional agents additional capacity have also been told this bill will overwhelm ice such there won't enough space detain violent criminals once again this not argument against bill argument for giving ice more resources for quickly deporting criminals these arguments say lot more about democrats unwillingness crack down illegal immigration than say about this bill look vote took wednesday adopted senator cornyn's amendment require illegal immigrants who assault police officer detained staggeringly under current law this not case but days ago our democratic colleagues could not even bring themselves support detaining illegal immigrant who assaults police officer right more than half democrats u.s senate

student loans cornyn president yesterday highlighted some president biden's final actions leaves--parting gifts will today would like highlight another his parting gifts use parentheses with quotations because really are slap face for american people american taxpayers this past monday department education canceled student loans for 150,000 borrowers this not really cancellation those loans just transfer responsibility taxpayers wiping slate clean for people who actually agreed borrow this money can attend schools then wednesday just days ago biden administration announced additional cancellation 4.5 billion for 261,000 borrowers president's actions this week last week his presidency brings this total taxpayer bailout 183.6 billion now remember june supreme court ruled 6-to-3 decision department education lacks authority--the legal authority--to implement these across-the-board student loan cancellations but biden administration never one actually obeys law has continued ignore ruling supreme court issuing blank check after blank check borrowers let them off hook from paying bills agreed pay first instance this policy not just illegal profoundly unfair unfair families who have sacrificed saved send their own children college unfair students who worked multiple jobs during college avoid accruing large amounts debt unfair all graduates who have worked hard paid off their loans finally unfair americans who have forgone college education because couldn't afford cost now have pick tab for those for whom president biden has canceled their debt any family with mortgage car payment credit card debt knows there really such thing canceling debt somebody going pay every dollar was borrowed will eventually repaid somebody just matter who someone this case american taxpayer really slap face kick teeth--you choose your metaphor but surprise american taxpayers have rejected direction which president biden his administration have taken country voted for new direction november but just makes even more offensive lameduck president would proceed full speed ahead with more student debt cancellation after being told supreme court being told again voters november back may along with colleagues senator ernst senator cassidy introduced congressional resolution disapproval would have overturned biden administration's reckless unfair student loan socialism course democratic-controlled senate did not bring cra--the congressional review act--up for vote but now with republicans majority hope this something can will address student loan socialism would great opportunity for department government efficiency--headed elon musk vivek ramaswamy--to take look because there nothing less efficient more wasteful more unfair than taking billions dollars from taxpayers who didn't college pay for those who did who agreed pay money back but simply now will not have vast majority americans don't benefit from this student loan socialism percent americans don't have student debt percent who are now foisting responsibility percent look page s241 those who benefit becomes even more clear how little sense this makes even progressive brookings institute pointed out blanket student loan forgiveness benefits those who are better off income education wealth unsurprisingly those with student loans are more likely have higher paying jobs look back institutions not just individuals who are benefiting from these massive taxpayer subsidies which what are will also find this anything but efficient use american taxpayer dollars over 100 colleges universities united states including columbia cornell yale princeton are currently under investigation from department education because their mishandling incidents anti-semitism their campuses since october title civil rights act prohibits discrimination basis ethnicity for institutions receive federal funding complaints anti-semitism wake terrorist attacks israel have some cases amounted violations federal law many these colleges universities are rushing enter into settlements with biden administration before trump administration takes office monday which course not surprising president trump has made clear taxpayer support for those universities failed end anti-semitic propaganda has run rampant over past few years taxpayer support will end now not time reward these institutions with widespread incentives continue raising their tuition canceling student debt want address affordability college--an important topic--widespread student loan socialism not way said for variety reasons this would great place for department government efficiency shine light for something about coming days committee for responsible federal budget pointed out could save taxpayers much 550 billion reversing all president biden's actions student loan cancellation--$550 billion have our work cut out for but one great place start would end biden administration's reckless student loan

business when assume full control government what republicans first order business going will helping working people donald trump promised campaign trail will increasing paychecks strengthening workers rights making healthcare more affordable will investing more american manufacturing jobs like democrats did years ago no--and again donald trump republicans promised fight for working americans but their actions already tell different story before even entering office donald trump working with republicans give very wealthy people megacorporations another round trillion-dollar tax cuts same time americans are struggling with inadequate childcare not page s47 enough healthcare inability buy home these republicans are talking about helping megacorporations wealthy people get tax cuts many them are saying let's cut social security let's cut medicare let's cut healthcare let's cut ability first-time homeowner buy home pay for instead working bipartisan way put needs working americans first republicans are getting ready use reconciliation process reward richest americans give more tax breaks america's biggest corporations obscene enough republicans want make tax cuts for ultrarich their first agenda item but gets worse when remember already cut taxes for those same people just few years ago all saw what disaster was last time donald trump republicans cut taxes for rich claimed would trickle down working people middle class most certainly did not republicans promised average household would see 4,000 extra per year but fact real median wages grew less than half half percent--less than half half percent--in years following these tax cuts executive pay bonuses meanwhile soared record highs stock buybacks which only reward shareholders hit record 2018 after trump tax cuts went into effect highest income earners america paid less effectively taxes than working class for first time ever imagine highest income earners paid less effectively taxes than

bottom half u.s households 2018 richest 400 families paid lower rate than bottom half u.s households 2018--paid lesser amount believe there nothing--nothing--pro-worker about cutting taxes for wealthiest people america but precisely what republicans are preparing one their first orders business are not debating whether should just what best way it--one bill two bills choose your poison already see clear difference between way republicans are preparing govern how democrats governed when had majority put bipartisanship first never made party-line votes only part our main agenda republicans seem prepared let's not forget--in first year democrats majority one our signature bills was bipartisan effort rebuild america's roads bridges highways put people work fix our infrastructure putting workers first 2022 democrats led bipartisan effort bring manufacturing back our shores make america world leader microchip production once again plant seeds for good-paying tech jobs america's heartland putting workers first even led bipartisan effort fix our immigration system with strongest--the strongest--border security bill over decade was bipartisan bill were hours away from voting bill here senate before donald trump killed for other reason than cynical political game troubling far have seen little indication from republican majority are interested continuing bipartisan streak last years are really interested helping working people america any way instead republicans seem ready use their majority back same old gop playbook tax cuts for ultrarich trickle-down fantasies turning their backs working americans whom promised fight for nominations president now nominations every time new administration begins one most important things senate does carefully evaluate consider vote president's cabinet nominees strong nominees only come from strong vetting process here senate have been very clear where democrats stand need thorough background investigations need hearings where both sides can prepare ask strong questions need vote here floor other words expect regular order deeply troubling then see our republican colleagues already beginning shun regular order yesterday chairman committee energy natural resources noticed hearing for governor doug burgum serve next secretary interior without minority consent has long been standard practice senate democrats committee expressed reasonable objections proceeding this hearing because committee had not yet received basic information governor burgum's background what are republicans trying hide rushing this other nominees through committee very reasonable wait little get additional background information both sides can ready for hearing why rush are republicans trying hide fact maybe some donald trump's nominees are not qualified for positions seek are republicans trying cover for nominees who will turn their backs working americans use agencies like department interior help giant polluters big business american people should know cabinet nominees will push policies kill good-paying clean energy jobs created under president biden these are good-paying jobs support communities red states blue states repealing these jobs would profoundly anti-worker might cause many their jobs americans deserve know what kind people are going serve president trump's cabinet need assurances these nominees will fight for them will cut costs hold big corporations accountable when republicans try rush nominees through process american people have wonder what are republicans trying hide gulf mexico president now finally want make brief comment about president-elect's press conference yesterday donald trump throws out lot strange rather random ideas regular basis did yesterday when suggesting rename gulf mexico gulf america well let say this would agree working with donald trump renaming gulf mexico only first agrees work with actual plan lower costs for americans what american people want focus first not renaming bodies water our priorities--our democratic priorities--are much more closely aligned with concerns american people than donald trump's seem incoming president knows has tall task ahead him spent years campaign trail making outlandish promises won't able keep fact getting ready opposite what promised cutting taxes for very very wealthy donald trump over his head doing what always does times like this distract america with crazy ideas renaming gulf mexico may zany new idea but isn't going help people save money grocery store not going make trips pharmacy more affordable not going help anyone find good-paying job donald trump says these things because will get him attention make him sound like tough guy donald trump wants rename ocean sound more patriotic would say will help him one condition only one condition let's come with real plan first--not concept plan--to lower prices for americans let's first then donald trump can have his fun yield floor presiding officer majority whip biden administration barrasso president months ago american people gave republicans clear mandate page s48 mandate get america back

leave joe biden's shelf life has expired time for him our first days office republicans have started get america back track working with president trump will put our focus what american people care about stopping chaos border taking handcuffs off american energy production putting safety security future all americans first yield floor presiding officer democratic whip remembering jimmy carter durbin president for many presidents their legacy written sealed their actions office--their post-presidency activities nothing but fodder for tabloids footnote history books--but not for jimmy carter remember last days carter presidency after 444 painful days sustained frustrating efforts release american hostages being held tehran witnessed their welcome but cynically timed release last day our nation's peaceful transfer power from president carter president reagan president carter's main goal had been make sure every hostage returned home alive score succeeded leaving office years age passing away end last month 100 president jimmy carter had longest post-presidency our nation's history certainly made count same faith empathy desire help others motivated him run for office compelled him continue improving world after left office not content with rocking page s49 chair retirement president carter devoted himself human rights conflict resolution election monitoring healthcare affordable housing much more was humble man world politics where humility often first casualty but there doubt corners globe near far jimmy carter left his mark public servant can ask for greater legacy our 39th president lies state u.s capitol just few steps away from this chamber before laid final rest time for paying respects reflecting president carter's legacy tasks each one with looking inward asking how can use place life more good for more people today send thoughts all those who knew loved were inspired president carter our nation world are better off because his service may rest peace yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll bill clerk proceeded call roll cornyn president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered 119th congress cornyn president with new session senate new majority house senate--actually house had majority but senate has new majority--and president trump white house one first things members senate had choose which committees serve have been proud serve senate judiciary finance intelligence committee previous congresses this congress will joining budget committee for 119th congress was particularly interested joining budget committee because one biggest challenges have get our budget under control with approaching trillion debt are paying more interest national debt than are defense time when president trump asked nato their investment their own defense percent gdp stand about 2.7 percent gpd here home clearly need rightsize our spending our debt reprioritize what are trying here national security believe preeminent responsibility u.s congress will have opportunity pass budget with reconciliation instructions not sure how much american people care about process care about process because have deal with but first thing have pass budget something haven't done since 2017 remember 2017 right after president trump was sworn even before was sworn into office passed budget resolution from which got ability then pass tax cuts jobs act one most significant tax reform bills years but got budget passed before president trump even took office because resolution between house senate doesn't require presidential signature already january have days until president trump puts his hand bible sworn into his second term office don't have any time waste reason why budget important for variety reasons but one reason because allows pass budgetary legislation using majority threshold which would allow republicans alone hopefully democrats will join but with republicans everybody same page hopefully will able pass legislation addressing our budgetary challenges have unique rules here senate one called byrd rule which tries make sure don't use reconciliation process budgetary process pass substantive legislation opposed budgetary legislation something are going have work out with house because know house has different rules don't have any constraint types things can using reconciliation like senate does but reason why important for house senate get same page there some discussion here capitol hill about whether want pass one budget two budgets more--actually even one budget with multiple reconciliation bills frankly don't think process important get job done need save american people multitrillion-dollar tax increase which will occur unless can renew expiring provisions tax cuts jobs act indicated earlier need deal with our rising debt our funding for our national security purposes goal course for national security funding establish deterrence deter whether iran has aspirations for nuclear weapons has created much havoc misery middle east whether north korea testing hypersonic missiles along with nuclear weapons whether russia which has aspirations restore former soviet union russian empire currently means taking ukraine back then there china which--as presiding officer knows with all his experience asia--is huge challenge for united states president has stated wants people's liberation army prepared 2027 take taiwan whatever means necessary are not ready have ready maintain reestablish deterrence does not happen president wakes day after day says himself not today tomorrow wakes says not today what deterrence about again need deal with our budgetary challenges because are not spending amount money need spend defense deterrence nor are spending money spend believe wisest most appropriate manner given current circumstances whether pursue single reconciliation bill multiple bills can't sight goal pass president trump's agenda for american people what november election was all about are lockstep with president trump believe majority house senate--to accomplish goal but can't unless work closely together which why need same page need quickly arrive agreement can act swiftly implement solutions will help improve day-to-day lives our constituents people represent--in case million people state texas president biden's policies have been disaster for state for american people texans have been suffering under open borders high prices for last years those who run businesses are facing burdensome regulations from out-of-control regulatory regime top this mentioned republicans fail act swiftly extend expiring tax cuts percent taxpayers will experience tax increase--62 percent can't let happen would insult injury top 40-year-high inflation for american people have experience tax cut increase are unsuccessful while have important conversations healthy debates over what budget reconciliation ends looking like need keep our eye prize order deliver these critical priorities for american people now addition border security abundant american energy regulatory reform permitting reform avoiding this multitrillion dollar tax increase there one more thing would like colleagues remember deliberate contents this package believe have once-in-a-generation opportunity deal with some biggest challenges face america can't squander opportunity have address not only our discretionary spending which about percent what federal government spends each year but also our mandatory spending programs outside social security medicare are not going touch social security medicare absent some bipartisan agreement page s50 but there still about 700 billion mandatory spending federal government spends each year essentially autopilot can address these mandatory spending programs implementing commonsense reforms programs like snap--otherwise known food stamps--that have grown unchecked for years simply reducing payment errors for snap payments for example could save estimated 100 billion implementing real work requirement for means-tested programs like congress did back during clinton presidency could save incredible amount money for american people help ease inflation federal reserve can bring down interest rates could repeal controversial 2021 thrifty food plan would save much 300 billion are talking about real money but not just programs got plus-ups during pandemic let's take look for example irs rescinding remaining unspent inflation reduction act funds were directed irs during democrats massive spending spree could save additional billion now think about for minute could save taxpayers billion just sending less money agency when comes process their tax payments seems like no-brainer ever heard one this money has not been spent there are other demands future congress needs address then are prepared act those but simply leave billion unspent act there nothing can about time sky-high inflation reckless spending think would irresponsible our part here another idea repealing davis-bacon law requires federal construction projects are carried out applies them requires payment prevailing wage--which isn't necessarily market wage location are talking about--the department transportation alone could save 400 million turning our federal workforce our federal workforce does large great work important work behalf american people but reforming pension system for federal employees bring benefit calculation line with private sector standard government could save billion over next decade could reform structure federal employee health benefit program save additional billion these are just few examples what would call low-hanging fruit opportunities for save taxpayer money begin reverse reckless spending policies last years these are just some examples longer list could save taxpayers much trillion over next 10-year period course think ought put all table--the money spend through discretionary spending money spend through mandatory programs money spent through tax code child tax credit earned income tax credit alone represent 200 billion spending this using tax code basically create supplement our welfare system because refundable tax credit which means people get check--get cold hard cash--using tax code need restore tax code its original purpose not hijack for purposes expanding welfare state can have healthy debates about what priorities should think child tax credit very important can talk about appropriate levels all these various programs including those included tax code but have start somewhere have start soon little things add over past years families back home texas have had reevaluate their budgets why shouldn't federal government have make hard choices folks back home are making daily weekly basis have had tighten their belts result high inflation highest interest rates have had long time which have eaten away their monthly incomes have figured out can figure out here too for american people for federal government think only fair u.s congress which holds purse strings for u.s government whole should have same thing families all across texas all across tennessee all across country are having regular basis doesn't seem fair have folks back home have make these tough choices while congress has been spending away under democratic majority control with president biden white house this another reason excited about great work republicans are going doge caucus department government efficiency alongside our friend elon musk his partner crime vivek ramaswamy say tongue cheek president but have volunteered their efforts raised visibility profile some massive inefficiency federal spending way think will able galvanize attention american people enable get political courage what need cut out waste fraud abuse this republican-led congress can make impact reducing our spending know are all excited about opportunities are chomping bit just need all get same page can get down work would urge all colleagues remember budget reconciliation not only allows allocate resources places like southern border which have been flatout ignored biden administration but also tool reduce spending--inefficient wasteful spending--and right-size our priorities know budgets are all about priorities have things must have have things would like have have things want but can't afford those are decisions families have make regular basis small businesses all across country why not federal government there good reason federal government shouldn't have operate under same rules while can notch some big wins coming weeks need eat our spinach too know have been kicking lot these issues down road until now when have run out road elected representatives american people this our responsibility not always going fun not necessarily always going popular but believe explain american people necessity doing what have been talking about here will understand will respect accept after all this something propose do--that have because what american people told want which change direction for country their vote november this last year yield floor presiding officer senator from virginia birthright citizenship kaine president spoke senate floor december about birthright citizenship--the guarantee contained 14th amendment u.s constitution all persons born united states subject jurisdiction thereof are deemed citizens reviewed legal history this provision legal guarantee designed erase horrible legacy slavery had been embodied dred scott sandford decision was desire correct decision led inclusion this definition citizenship 14th amendment also rebutted during speech too common misconceptions first children born united states parents from other countries are not subject jurisdiction united states has been ruled false supreme court since late 1890s second claim often made president-elect united states unique world guaranteeing citizenship all who are born within this country indeed will discuss few minutes united states did fact lead way guaranteeing birthright citizenship 1860s but doing has led global movement many other countries have decided embrace believe constitutional basis for birthright citizenship clear those challenging notion are mounting argument with legal page s51 basis but today want move beyond legal history talk about good birthright citizenship brings our nation children born america immigrant parents from all corners world from all social conditions have been enormous benefit our country indeed commonwealth virginia more than million people living united states were born another country another million american children were born here immigrant parents currently more than percent all american children live household where least one their parents immigrant how has immigration affected american society let's use one example--crime statistics are compelling longstanding immigration does not increase crime instead evidence strong crime has decreased immigration has increased 1980 immigrants made 6.2 percent american population--45 years ago 2022 percentage had more than doubled with immigrants now making nearly percent american population what happened crime during period percentage immigrants united states doubled during this time crime rate this country--as measured crimes committed per 100,000 people--had fallen percent again portion our population immigrant has more than doubled crime rate our country has fallen more than percent recent study conducted scholars northwestern university pulled crime data from united states going back 150 years during 150-year period were able reach uniform conclusion immigrants during this 150-year period have always been incarcerated lower rates than native-born americans another recent study commissioned national institute justice within doj looked all crimes committed texas from 2012 2018 found undocumented immigrants--the earlier statistics have been giving are about immigrants generally but this study texas found undocumented immigrants are arrested less than half rate native-born u.s citizens for violent crimes drug crimes less than quarter rate native-born citizens for property crimes immigration plus for american economy immigrant households generated more than 236 billion income 2022 paid nearly billion local state federal taxes congressional budget office estimates immigration flows united states

were started children immigrants fully percent new businesses were started immigrants children immigrants clear me--the great-grandson seven irish immigrants scottish immigrant whose dad was scottish

virginians had been born another country today more like out has coincided during lifetime with virginia moving from bottom quarter per capita income among american states top quarter movement has been significantly advanced talented people from around world deciding wanted make virginia their home enough statistics how about some stories children immigrants have made powerful contributions very essence america where would american fashion without people like ralph lauren who just got presidential medal--born ralph lifshitz bronx parents who had emigrated from poland where would american politics without people like kamala harris born california parents who had emigrated from jamaica india marco rubio born florida parents who had emigrated from cuba nikki haley born south carolina

ability contribute our community part genius our nation believe birthright citizenship--put into our constitution 1860s rectify sin slavery egregious dred scott decision--has really been blessing our country has actually inspired global movement especially among nations americas guarantee citizenship all born within their borders there are slightly more than three dozen nations world guarantee birthright citizenship predominantly americas why did catch hold americas called ourselves new world was phrase often kind used for united states americas contrast with old world--mostly nations europe--that tended lock social status based who your parents were was reality was pretty common when english arrived jamestown 1607 plymouth rock 1619 europeans others were coming united states before declared our independence 1776 was fairly common for people locked into status which were born why many our ancestors wanted come united states--because would not locked into social status based upon their parents social status have look into future where their own kids grandkids great-grandkids would locked into status united states 14th amendment decided embrace definitively new-world concept are born this country are u.s citizen doesn't matter who your parents are have same opportunities responsibilities anyone born this country part genius this country could tell thousands

decade looking while just about everyone else seems have been looking other way--until now while this personal issue for should not partisan issue after all every american benefits from more efficient government everyone loses when tax dollars are wasted have worked across aisle number issues make washington more transparent accountable would invite anyone this body everyone who may watching home who has ideas join this conversation our movement because doge inevitable yield floor presiding officer mullin senator from nebraska page s57 ricketts president rise today compliment esteemed colleague from iowa who founding member doge caucus well elon musk vivek ramaswamy for their effort able create department government efficiency this something near dear heart because governor nebraska this what did focused how could drive efficiency through our state operations now want think about big argument between republicans democrats really macro scale--what is--it comes down what should government properly what should size scope government well there are actually things agree government should between republicans democrats for those things should them really really well all too often government fails because not properly managed because don't good job when don't good job end wasting taxpayers dollars governor nebraska this one things focused able better job on--take private sector experiences coming from business world applying them running state government showed things private sector will work running public sector well state nebraska implemented lean six sigma lean six sigma process improvement methodology there are number them out there this one chose what does break down operation count what steps are what steps know should get frontline people engaged--the people actually doing work involved looking those steps see can cut waste number steps everything else can make process more efficient how can better job actually providing services while reducing costs same time thing every time get government say want cut expenses blah blah blah are going cut services private sector can't your customers say well going reduce your prices but going also reduce your service because your customers will someplace else doesn't work way private sector figures out how better job providing services while reducing their expenses can same thing government private sector have competition going drive inefficient businesses out government sector going require people like elon vivek senators here this room able drive through our government agencies get efficiency want talk little bit about what did because was very effective mentioned measure steps count how many steps there are see where overlaps are one area did was air construction permits had 190 steps took issue permit cut down steps doing that--sorry was 110 steps cut down doing cut down from 190 days able issue permit days now can't change any environmental regulations was just better job issuing those permits when free your teammates time because are not wasting time all those extra steps can more work--they are more productive--and can focus things are going more important--for example more difficult permits used this variety ways showed lots improvement for example our economic assistance line august 2014 was taking about minutes answer phone call set goal setting minutes less answer those phone calls for those people who were calling seeking our assistance hit goal all way until pandemic was taking days issue snap applications--food stamps again are one those families need taking days process application what saying about how think about set goal getting applications done days hit all way until hit pandemic then even when got out compliance--when started going above days--we knew were above took steps start getting number back down again were able variety other ways like for example with department motor vehicles getting your driver's license our centers excellence were able get from minutes down minutes getting people out door with our green sheets which what used our department transportation able make sure our contractors were doing right things with regard environment antiquities whatever--making sure were following all rules--we were able cut from days down days those contractors could get into field faster get our projects moving faster here another one would issue reimbursement checks families with children who have special needs often these special needs children will have have specialized care families will have travel hospital get would get reimbursed for those expenses but was taking days reimburse those expenses well what wrong with over 2-week pay period those families had float those costs from one paycheck next paycheck know know lot families live paycheck paycheck put financial burden those families with kids with special needs were able cut time down days able make sure could get those expense checks back those families need wouldn't have float experience financial hardship from one payment next well what did have had get everybody board--our entire team end day state nebraska trained over 30,000 our teammates lean six sigma process there were wipeouts kind introductory one over 6,200 our mid-level managers yellow belts next level trained 248 executive green belts those are upper level executives--again more training then trained nine black belts those are folks who oversee whole program implementing all were able save over 900,000 hours our teammates time did over 1,000 different projects saved 115 million hard savings because those processes for example were able reduce square footage were occupying state nebraska 60,000 was 60,000 square feet took off our rolls reduced our employment 3\1/2 percent were able control spending before became governor our budget was growing 6\1/2 percent year would say was not sustainable were able average while was governor keep growth our budget 2.8 percent year--just 2.8 percent year average might just contrast what are doing here federal government right now 2019 spent 4.4 trillion 2024 was closer 6.8 trillion 6.9 trillion roughly 55-percent increase just years folks not sustainable why what this department government efficiency doge what this incoming administration are going important have got able get our spending under control risk our country have got get this under control can can better job providing services keeping our expenses down just like private sector does leveraging tools like lean six sigma just like private sector does presiding officer senator from kansas marshall president know most every january hard working families across this country gather together their kitchen tables work budget then once month try balance their checkbooks making budget balancing checkbooks congress seems incapable doing either these why today this country faces national debt over trillion--$36 page s58 trillion believe debt greatest threat have our long-term national security future america many ways first need look how got here how did get trillion national debt think many feel has been driven federal waste fraud gross mismanagement now last year's federal deficit--i want think about this are talking about deficit now have national debt trillion have deficit each year this last fiscal year federal government took trillion but spent trillion let say again took trillion but managed spend trillion pretty simple math for deficit some trillion this last year eclipsed new benchmark federal government spent more interest payments--on interest alone--on debt than did funding national defense medicare let say again spent more making interest payment than did national defense medicare matter what your priorities are--whether schools roads bridges maybe think need more military when are spending trillion year nation interest lots things are going unaccomplished american people have clearly spoken million people elected donald trump president with them his priorities deal with bureaucratic inefficiencies overregulation government prioritizes beltway politics over heartland all without any transparency accountability what talking about pentagon can't account for 824 billion improper federal payments were 236 billion pandemic relief fraud abuse was 200 billion right there together just those three items alone add 1.2 trillion waste fraud mismanagement take peek again biden-harris administration's open border policies think about costs taking these million--maybe more--illegal immigrants least 150 billion our department education spent over billion promoting dei initiatives schools let say again--$1 billion promoting dei initiatives schools but our kids can't read write math meanwhile u.s government adds billion debt daily are billion time wake morning bed wake next day have added another billion debt total debt now said earlier over trillion again are making interest payment trillion each year this where doge comes what can doge here proud one founding members appreciate senator ernst's leadership this committed addressing this crisis reforming federal government operate with efficiency accountability americans deserve address this spending crisis need plan need accountability have some simple reforms can make day one slash spending disrupt unaccounted-for blank check spending are seeing out this federal government here are just few examples have been sharing these with people who are coming into this new administration this were business first thing would when would have seen had spent trillion more than had taken in--the first thing would would freeze federal employees would not hire any more federal employees next would require all federal employees return their offices work know maybe only out maybe out federal employees are actually back office working next would decentralize federal government there are many functions federal government could better less costly would move them out this environment next would implement term limits for political appointees well long-term employees think there are opportunities for agency consolidations can modernize system are spending percent 100 billion annually outdated system here federal government opportunities would save financially with regulatory reform are infinite could roll back energy mandates epa limits methane emission rules could expand federal land leasing for oil gas production next would talk about cutting subsidy waste--getting rid some tax credits for instance taxpayer-funded electric vehicle subsidies could done away with why world are giving tax credits foreign entities have foreign countries foreign entities are benefiting from some these tax credits well our grant oversight just pitiful spending money with ngo research grants don't know who spending where going then are funding billions dollars gain-of-function research teaching china how develop weapons against americans biodefense program for niaid spending over billion annually again help communist china develop bioweapons against americans need more research accountability there are opportunities for education reform then with taxation irs reform could rescind billion for irs funding under ira act well certainly simplifying tax laws would great opportunity well those are just few just handful ideas have passed doge president trump's team look forward working with them think enough said enough enough time for federal agencies unelected bureaucrats remember people sign their checks doge absolutely committed restoring accountability putting federal government back path serving american people these solutions will give beltway bureaucrats fits--it will give them heartburn--but these reforms will finally put federal government notice path start working like business will close with this doge can help identify prioritize waste doge going help identify prioritize waste fraud mismanagement but congress put their gloves roll their sleeves get work done yield floor presiding officer senator from missouri schmitt president rise speak about grave threat administrative state poses our country what can stop want thank senator from oklahoma for sort leading effort here today talk about this air this out senate floor quite frankly one big surprises think first years here u.s senate how little actually talk about this how little time have spent addressing this many conversations happen inside beltway here are detached from conversations have back home missouri quite frankly people whom talk who work hard every day can't believe waste happens here can't believe spend millions dollars drag shows dei trainings countries halfway around world knew more about guess would even bigger topic conversation there would more outrage think part what table setting going over next months here which identify these things talk about them highlight them something about last year when gave inaugural speech senate floor talked about how administrative state was one biggest threats our republic nameless faceless bureaucrats who are accountable nobody promulgate rules regulations deeply impact everyday americans every day epa can promulgate rule devastates farmers farm has been family for generations can under water just like don't even know whom talk about ranchers are impacted none these folks are ultimately ever held accountable don't know page s59 their name their title ambiguous are agency have never heard loper bright case supreme court just recently heard dealt significant blow power administrative state involved noaa which was attempting force fishermen case pay out their own pocket for federal observers their own boats there are many many more examples than just this particular case but this one made supreme court had impactful decision real americans--real americans--have been impacted this bloated bureaucratic mess has developed over decades while administrative state still great threat our country good news president trump will soon occupy white house doge will soon get work can finally have some real momentum dismantle administrative state once for all returning power back people see difference when senator from oklahoma gets elected get elected folks get say can send back can send home want ban gas stoves should have vote guess would receive very few votes but have got bureaucrat not even office anymore--because only percent them are actually office--making these kinds decisions every sense accountability our representative form government ultimately undermined ensure president trump doge hit ground running yesterday introduced two bills are critical one-two punch dismantling administrative state first bill called eraser act which prohibits any agency from issuing rule unless same agency has repealed least three rules additionally bill prohibits agency from issuing major rule unless agency has repealed three more rules cost new major rule less than equal cost rule being repealed this would make agencies think twice before promulgating new regulations because agencies are addicted power comes from regulating americans could have added benefit stripping many regulations from books altogether freeing americans from bonds overregulation second bill called separation powers restoration act which builds supreme court's ruling loper bright case tearing down chevron deference have lived with for decades this bill would enact stricter standard review longer can agencies expect courts just side with their interpretation statute like could when chevron deference was place this bill would institute novo standard review under novo standard review courts will weigh merits arguments without deference--without deference standards--to either side placing american citizens businesses either caught wrong side regulatory enforcement action challenging validity first place equal footing court with agency this critical effort which will strip power away from unelected bureaucrats put power back hands americans look forward working hand hand with trump administration elon musk vivek ramaswamy colleagues doge caucus finally reform dismantle administrative state shrink size federal government reinstitute fiscal sanity here washington

hegseth's military service indeed when evaluating his nomination--his service was what appreciated most about his background--but unfortunately clear hegseth does not have skills experience record character lead department has budget more than 800 billion largest employer men women our country tasked with safeguarding our nation's security freedom take pride americans fact our military very best standard excellence professionalism set men women our armed forces central our military's success our country's success this high standard competency character both unmatched ability uncommon virtue why america's armed forces command respect our friends fear our foes abiding faith freedom-loving people everywhere america boasts greatest fighting force history world heroes who serve our armed forces deserve leader who worthy greatness hegseth plainly not task like many colleagues have concerns regarding hegseth's character--the documented accusations about his excessive uncontrolled drinking his sexual harassment sexual assault now accusations being abusive his ex-wife ironic hegseth some colleagues have dismissed these concerns partisan because sadly this weren't partisan confirmation process--for example republican colleagues were considering hiring hegseth join their staffs--we would all agree these accusations would immediately disqualifying hegseth dismisses these multiple accusations from disparate people coordinated smear campaign don't think concerns his former colleagues friends family should quickly dismissed smears many other nominees who are being considered this body aren't facing similar accusations even though there are people who vehemently oppose their confirmations which begs question why hegseth continues face multiple similar accusations from different sources but for moment let's hegseth asks put aside these accusations let say for moment those who occupy highest positions public life shouldn't above reproach although indeed should let say our servicemembers not deserve leader whose strength character matches their own although believe let say for moment character does not count although indeed surely always does let short ignore everything hegseth demanded ignore his hearing even did would submit based experience alone hegseth mainly unqualified for job secretary defense secretary defense responsible for budget more than 800 billion responsible for 3.4 million employees who serve every continent across globe lead defense department daunting task requires leadership managerial skills highest order however hegseth's managerial experience begins ends with his leadership two small nonprofits his tenure both resulted concerns about his financial mismanagement their helm hegseth could not did not effectively manage organizations with around 100 employees surely one can actually believe ready manage one 3.4 million people live dangerous uncertain world iran its proxies continue menace our forces middle east vladimir putin march europe north korea persists testing our allies testing its missiles china--china--looks with conqueror's gaze toward taiwan republican colleagues understand

stars come out west point most revered public servants serve these halls did not need then nor need now turn green rooms cable networks for secretary defense tomorrow marks 80th anniversary battle bulge--a campaign which father served freezing temperatures outnumbered often undersupplied our forces held line against hitler's onslaught our soldiers because were brave because were skilled because were well led surely armed forces united states america--the victors ardennes gettysburg midway 1,000 places between since--surely need leader who can have full faith surely america's best deserves best government's most important task keep america safe secure free complex fast-moving evolving challenge job times presents its occupant--the secretary defense--no good easy options short deadly serious job where both success failure have enormous ramifications job depends experience character--the prerequisites for good judgment like other senator should vote for someone who can only hope will learn job--not for secretary defense senator should vote for nominee hope will display more personal discipline once page s350 gets job there are strong experienced able members president's party whose views align with his who could exceptional leaders department defense hegseth not one them urge colleagues reject this nominee yield floor presiding officer senator from connecticut murphy president come floor join many colleagues expressing grave alarm over choice pete hegseth run department defense not hyperbole say have never seen candidate--at least modern times--to lead our soldiers our troops who dangerously woefully unqualified pete hegseth think everybody understands his primary qualification was during weekends when donald trump would watch fox news--period stop--because have learned more about pete hegseth--his history sexual misconduct his history public drunkenness his history financial mismanagement--it appears there must thousands other people who were easily more qualified but want talk today about his qualifications his views has made known television has expressed committee about how would job think his history personal misconduct itself disqualifying just embarrassment country moment when want more friends allies just wrong match for department oversees moral professional development young men women have somebody like with kind history leading agency but also important views has expressed how would run department defense because fear will run into ground first let talk about politicization department defense listen don't like fact all across government design seems don't agree with president trump's political ideas don't pledge loyalty president trump don't have any future federal government not how have ever run federal government yes have always had class political appointees yes want people very top each department broadly aligned with your view world but this administration--most recently reclassifying thousands employees federal government make them political make them immediately fireable fundamental rewrite way traditionally view government want civil servants people whose oath whose loyalty american public constitution law not simply political party political ideology kash patel has made very clear doesn't want anybody department justice who doesn't line with his particular political view world pete hegseth seems same mind seems proposing creating department defense abandons its core values its traditional review processes favor new culture paranoia mistrust amidst unexplained firings for even being perceived having wrong political leanings now this didn't happen inside department defense but highest profile firing national security chain command monday--on trump's first day office--he fired head coast guard commandant linda fagan without explanation beyond anonymous statements press about vague concerns about fagan's approach programs aimed improving diversity opportunity within coast guard many have had opportunity work with admiral fagan straight shooter improved morale coast guard has vigorously defended our shores has helped increase readiness there nothing political--there was nothing political--about linda fagan her career service this country become first woman lead coast guard yet was fired monday without explanation except for these anonymously sourced vague concerns about her focus trying bring more women into coast guard more cadets color seems serve very clear end make everybody wonder what line nobody knows line linda fagan crossed but now blurred everybody going hunker down buckle down nothing all may arise suspicions white house seems exactly what going happen department defense has promised fire top-end military leaders who are engaged his nebulous war woke care about making sure have got troops from different backgrounds different parts country maybe war woke promote woman maybe war woke care about making sure your troops don't engage unethical conduct maybe war woke contract with local business may not aligned with donald trump maybe part war woke have idea what will happen inside department defense just constant sense paranoia constant looking over your shoulder grinding halt business normal because nobody knows what fireable offense what isn't how stay good side pete hegseth what gets bad side second want talk about his views women combat wrote this his book dads push take risks moms put training wheels our bikes need moms but not military especially combat units what insulting thing say what disgusting thing believe dads push take risks moms put training wheels our bikes mom taught take risks dad told take risks too but there single u.s senator here who believes our mothers women our lives aren't risk takers didn't push better pete hegseth believes--he just believes this--that women hold back women hold men back women hold their sons back just doesn't matter has walked back these statements magically had conversion issue women military magically started saying less offensive things about women right after was nominated secretary defense nobody believes this conversion this conversion for political reasons only does not mask fact this what pete hegseth believes believes women are inferior men--and again not just shouldn't engage combat believes are morally inferior have qualities men don't have many women--most women know--who have served bravely effectively combat--some serving with capitol hill--have taken grave offense pete hegseth's unfounded denigration their service many have pointed out real impacts his ideas will have surrounding women combat what those comments could mean for our more general readiness why because there are 360,000 women serving u.s military today variety capacities are essential keeping this nation safe now every single one them knows man taking over department defense doesn't think are worthy serve their prospects for advancement upon his elevation department defense are compromised their ability get fair treatment inside department defense has been compromised won't shock anybody see many those women leave service see many fewer women sign protect this country would come enormous cost--an enormous cost--to security this nation third want talk about topic hope this body finds way have nonpolitical nonpartisan discussion growing problem extremism our military now think every large organization has tackle this issue anytime have big large organization are going have individuals amongst your ranks are affiliated with extremists dangerous causes don't page s351 think this problem exclusive u.s military but people who have military experience are about percent percent overall population comprise percent people who were pardoned donald trump just days ago--a share three times greater than general population have watched disproportionate share individuals who have engaged mass shootings have had military background now lot connected post-traumatic stress disorder our failure get services those individuals should have conversation well but pete hegseth has said this issue whether oath keepers proud boys have influence inside military--and there are plenty reports there are lots active channels communication recruitment between these rightwing groups military--he says problem fake fake now don't know extent this problem but know something should talk about very very worried have secretary defense who doesn't believe problem even worth mentioning lastly want talk about what maybe think most dangerous part pete hegseth's views military his history support for war criminals his low regard for code military justice his disbelief--his nonbelief concept international law laws war pretty shocking are even having debate here about whether u.s military should engage torture adhere geneva conventions for those served with john mccain cannot believe what would think about decision republican president appoint secretary defense who does not believe geneva conventions basic laws war claims weak unmanly believe there should some common set rules about how engage war think legitimate have conversation about rules engagement should always willing revisit rules engagement entirely possible--plausible even--that rules apply our soldiers very difficult complicated engagements where often don't know who friend foe are outdated should willing have conversation but not what pete hegseth interested interested obliterating rules engagement doesn't want any constraints our soldiers while true many enemies fight don't follow any rules all not good for u.s security more broadly give international law rules war rules engagement just accept race bottom hearing ranking member reed asked pete hegseth about three instances clemency granted president trump 2019--grants clemency nominee supports one soldier lieutenant army had been serving for years prison was pardoned after being convicted two counts second-degree murder for ordering soldier fire unarmed afghan motorcyclists 2012 another was pardoned after being charged with murder afghan 2010 another pardon was for individual who posed took photos with corpse during 2017 deployment iraq this problem minuscule inside our armed forces really president 99.99 percent our soldiers men women who fight for are never ever engaged these kinds horrific crimes reason for because have good moral people fighting for because have code conduct deterrent helps make sure instances misconduct are very very small--are infinitesimal all sudden code conduct obliterated then becomes harder for our military leadership make sure when are war are following those rules engagement remember our power world our tanks our soldiers our airplanes our aircraft carriers but has always been our moral authority have never been perfect have never had leadership was perfect but voluntarily give our belief u.s troops are held higher standard than our enemies--that shrinks our power world makes enemies run away from world today where there just dissent from truth right what putin wants putin wants obliterate objectivism this world believe there right wrong everything just individual's viewpoint when retreat from those long-held consensus-developed ideas about for instance not torturing our enemies during times war provides lift assist people like putin who are trying make believe there such thing right wrong world all just different shades gray understand much debate here will about this litany really ugly personal misconduct think reason alone say know what find somebody else not pete hegseth only person qualified run department defense there are other people who are loyal donald trump who are conservative maybe even believe this campaign against wokeism but don't have history personal misconduct but also think these questions about women combat about political campaigns will run inside department will breed sense paranoia about taking seriously small but growing real threats like extremism military then this bigger question making sure have fealty laws war prohibitions against torture--i think all those really concerning views this nominee even misconduct didn't exist would enough for say find somebody else find somebody else who just going job instead trying bring these political agendas whether misogyny anti-wokeism anti multilateralism into job really should pretty simple lead our troops protect nation lift america's standing world know cake may baked this point but just want make one more plea republican colleagues reconsider their decision confirm lead department defense somebody who seems just hellbent mostly pursuing political--not military--agenda truly believe certain weaken our armed forces threaten our national security yield floor presiding officer murkowski senator from oregon wyden madam president number serious concerning issues were raised pete hegseth's nomination hearing last week hegseth nomination hearing last week there were number important issues would like speak one central both america's national security american values principle every american has right know when their government believes allowed kill them now don't believe this ought controversial matter constituents don't believe should controversial matter bill rights says one shall deprived life without due process law government officials have view basic obligation explain any rules allow them ever kill american citizen this nominee serve defense secretary has simply flunked test his refusal answer basic questions before senate committee armed services ought trouble every single american now want focus fundamental question concerning government's power kill americans why americans have keep fighting--and senators--for transparency over decade ago obama administration took position their analysis president's legal authority deliberately kill americans was secret refused share said time believe position was just unacceptable told obama administration american takes arms against united states part foreign army terrorist group there are indeed circumstances where legal use lethal force against american but limits page s352 boundaries president's authority kill americans must available public voters can decide whether authority has sufficient safeguards now obama administration initially disagreed with were clearly reluctant acknowledge specific limits president's power candid had pretty big public argument about over number weeks many other senators got involved fact senator paul our colleague from kentucky brought debate head with 13-hour standing filibuster remember coming senate floor join senator paul there were number republican colleagues who were there well think one reasons became such significant debate viral moment was literally exactly what our founding fathers envisioned members senate coming together check power presidency response this filibuster senator paul others were part obama administration came around doing right thing attorney general holder sent senator paul letter stating clearly american standing u.s soil not engaged combat then president united states does not have authority use military force against them now obviously there are host other important questions about limits president's war powers but thought letter from attorney general holder was important concession proud democrats republicans worked together bipartisan basis for was very troubled last week answers pete hegseth gave his nomination hearing before armed services committee for example our colleague senator hirono asked nominee directly would carry out order shoot american citizens hegseth could have given same answer attorney general holder gave decade ago but this nominee just refused answer question madam president even more troubling when our colleague senator slotkin asked even easier question senator slotkin asked there such thing illegal order answer question should very obviously yes president orders secretary defense violate law constitution order illegal view stunning nominee refused answer this very straightforward question even our youngest soldiers basic training know their duty refuse illegal orders should least expect much from our secretary defense say colleagues closing comes down this thought agreed--democrats republicans people variety different political philosophies--believe what have discussed are fundamentally important principles america have fought hard america uphold them did together for life don't understand why are voting today confirm nominee who can't tell pointblank will oppose illegal orders will uphold constitution united states for reason madam president--i haven't spoken matter until just now--i intend vote hegseth's nomination frankly wish more colleagues across aisle for reasons have been outlined here were joining voting yield floor presiding officer senator from rhode island whitehouse madam president nice see chair presiding officer nice being chair whitehouse madam president here add some thoughts regarding vote are going have pete hegseth for secretary defense course rhode island junior senator very cognizant important role senior senator jack reed has had committee jurisdiction senate armed services committee want give him credit for way has conducted himself what can bring this conversation little bit about background investigations sit judiciary committee judiciary committee does more background investigation work than any other because have many people coming through--the judges u.s attorneys every marshal--all are very busy bis took deep dive into brett kavanaugh background investigation put out report flaws gaps misdirections transpired around background investigation--specifically supplemental background investigation point will clarify moment let's start with what know about fbi background investigation into hegseth know only one democrat has even seen ranking member committee senator reed know has publicly said background investigation was--to use his word--``inadequate republicans are going forward basis fbi investigation very respected member this body has publicly said was inadequate what else know about well has been reported press chairman has said took three briefings fbi get through background investigation don't know why happened but know new material emerged press about various kinds misconduct this individual after initial background investigation took place likeliest scenario explain why there were three background investigations light recurring release further information about his repeated misconduct there were supplemental background investigations after original full field fbi background investigation was completed let's presume true again can't know this because this all tied much unnecessary secrecy view let's presume case what does mean well what discovered during kavanaugh background investigation regular fbi full field background investigation takes place under set longstanding rules protocols procedures have forms follow has been routinized fairly significant degree different than proper fbi investigation proper fbi investigation criminal law enforcement front has whole different set controls protocols supervisory roles over when get into full field background investigation are operating under different set rules but are still operating under rules can ask question fbi was this background investigation conducted fully within rules protocols for background investigations--until get supplemental background investigation now one objections had way were treated tried get bottom kavanaugh background investigation was then-head fbi kept repeatedly saying publicly--we were repeatedly told supplemental background investigation was done consistent with all fbi standard protocols procedures what was misleading about later discovered for supplemental background investigation there are operating procedures protocols wray said comported with all their procedures didn't disclose fact there are procedures comport with what fbi doing supplemental background investigation are doing only exactly what white house has instructed them do--period more less procedure protocol--which raises huge question about adequacy this background investigation extent its later stages was supplemental background investigation know when kavanaugh investigation was going republican senators were told there was corroboration corroboration being kind important legal term here--no corroboration charges had been brought blasey ford his attack her those many years ago--no corroboration what found out later instructions from white house page s353 fbi for supplemental background investigation related her charges were don't look for don't find don't report any corroborating information also found out never interviewed either blasey ford about her allegations brett kavanaugh about his conduct there every reason believe about this background investigation supplemental background investigation part was woefully incomplete was restricted white house very very narrow bounds not know what those narrow bounds are very likely neither hegseth nor individuals making charges were even interviewed fbi can suspect because precisely what happened kavanaugh background investigation there major major weakness what publicly described inadequate background investigation extent those latter two segments caused three briefings have take place were supplemental background investigations precisely exactly controlled trump white house another point relates all this when these witnesses came forward standard counterattack against them was were anonymous over over again hegseth said committee anonymous smears''--``anonymous smears these accusers were not anonymous not only were not anonymous were willing presented themselves willing able come over here personally brief their offices any republican senator not anonymous when are willing show senator's office give personal briefing what weren't willing was put their names out there publicly now why would want steer away from ask christine blasey ford what her life was turned into far-right maga attacks her after came forward with her charges against brett kavanaugh ask poll workers who were rudy giuliani's victims what their lives turned into after called them out--conduct against them gave rise massive multimillion-dollar verdict rudy giuliani still struggling pay evidently some billionaire paid off for him will see but perfectly logical for person willing come forward like many witnesses are identify themselves speak privately--the way people often grand jury--to prosecutor without yet putting your name out there actually some are not anonymous but should reject notion these witnesses were anonymous were not anonymous are real people with real faces who are willing come tell their real stories republican senators simply refuse hear them different thing than anonymity couldn't get through doors offices either our republican colleagues already know who these people are--so are not anonymous--or are perfectly able find out getting their names inviting them hearing them out seems like pretty simple ask now some cases for instance hegseth's sister-in-law--ex sister-in-law guess would say--has actually put her name her affidavit describing his abusive drunken misconduct not anonymous any stretch imagination because far-right counterattack team likes attack people who are willing come forward actually outed one other witnesses story won't mention her name because not want make things even worse for her but did out her rightwing publication have least two names are out there are clearly not anonymous indeed are public what happens with them what happens with them are accused having evil motive had motive lie about pete hegseth what driving what have been saying well guess who really good interviewing witnesses looking surrounding circumstances evaluating motive--the fbi fbi fbi this supplemental background investigation was instructed not evaluate motive--just let political hand grenade throw with foundation--then have extra layer problems with this background investigation there every reason believe background investigation was inadequate specifically directed white house away from relevant evidence way kavanaugh investigation was directed away from corroborating evidence here would have been directed away from evidence motive have got real problem your hands urge republican colleagues--this kind last call this guy gets starts behave way reasonable people can expect him behave are going own when say background investigation should have brought not didn't ask about background investigation not didn't get real one not didn't bring actual witnesses hear from them themselves have had another little event recently which are pardons violent january rioters before those pardons took place our republican colleagues said over over again will never happen this weird democrat pipe dream very notion pardoning these violent rioters who hurt police officers--who attacked harmed police officers--is absurd said one colleague vice president said wasn't going happen would wrong after all talk all reassurance what happened donald trump went right out did think there are guardrails around this individual has already been proven are not there thing thought was absurd thing thought would never happen thing said was wrong was done not lesson forward into these other defective nominees can't help can't make vote any other way but ought clear with future misconduct this guy whether being drunk duty erratic abusive inappropriate with female staff officers even abusing power our military accomplish political purposes for president trump there really sign guardrails prevent inadequate fbi report something should cleared before republicans are forced vote this your power look into these things get done not our power minority are doing best can urge consider those dangers move forward toward this vote yield floor presiding officer senator from massachusetts markey madam president are about have monumental vote out here floor u.s senate who will become next secretary defense for united states america defense budget united states 900 billion person who given responsibility has exceptionally well qualified order deal with all responsibilities are tied those military personnel decisions which have made because there are 3.5 million servicemembers there are hundreds thousands aircraft ships submarines combat vehicles satellites nuclear arsenal variety sources including his own writings implicate him with disregarding laws war financial mismanagement racist sexist remarks about americans uniform sexual assault sexual harassment other very troubling issues these are perilous times position secretary defense demands leader unparalleled experience wisdom above all else character secretary defense carries immense responsibility not only american people but servicemembers whom lead confirmed hegseth will have responsibility serve our servicemembers manner fair nonpartisan responsible yet hegseth has demonstrated incapable doing has said straight just saying should not have women combat roles page s354 opposed transgender people serving military despite their willingness serve sacrifice for our country right now called reproductive justice absolutely utterly meaningless military opposed pentagon policies help servicemembers get reproductive care including ivf start family these are american servicemembers find hegseth's record extremely alarming nominated lead agency charged with defending american freedom abroad yet does not stand for freedom dignity respect for servicemembers united states america military indeed hegseth's own writings alleged conduct should disqualify him from holding any leadership position military much less from being confirmed secretary defense for our nation donald trump dared impugn legacy late honorable congressman john lewis saying john lewis was all talk action but then trump nominates secretary defense pete hegseth who perpetuates lie racism black military officers are only promoted because their race tell colin powell tell lloyd austin were only promoted because their color this not just failure leadership moral crisis strikes heart who are people not enough just oppose trump's vision there are hundreds thousands women military right now percent our military african american these are hegseth's own words about this very high percentage members our military right now criticism hegseth bipartisan senators from both sides aisle are opposed this nomination didn't know anything else about him--if didn't have any more hearings didn't have any more documents didn't have any other people coming forward--we already have enough evidence eye-watering detail sufficient cast vote floor u.s senate this nomination because position secretary defense serious job need someone who will bring their game 24/7 365 days year pete hegseth not person his lack experience aside has not shown necessary morality sense judgment secretary defense take issue nuclear weapons this person want advising president whether not should launch nuclear weapon against another country possibly begin end life earth know secretary defense very important position puts him right heart these nuclear decisions this nomination joke are kidding pete hegseth will there helping decide whether not launch nuclear weapons let's clear president trump commander chief has sole authority order launch u.s nuclear arsenal this crazy its face one person can determine whether not start nuclear war with consultation with anyone else just absolutely absurd its face because one person particularly not president trump should have unilateral power start nuclear war have just reintroduced legislation with congressman ted lieu house representatives make policy united states president can use nuclear weapons first without express approval congress have not been attacked with nuclear weapons have got come congress but not law right now just president under constitution congress gets declare war not president but for now president trump has power exclusively any time for any reason can call over military attache with nuclear football call war room pentagon give order launch trump does not have consult with anyone--not congress not joint chiefs staff not secretary defense but president trump did want get second opinion before starting nuclear war which could end humanity calling secretary defense would usually pretty good option order make decision have any reason believe pete hegseth has any clue about nuclear weapons nuclear policy nuclear strategy not fact hegseth's only qualification for this job can see whether will whatever president asks him pete hegseth yes-man president trump calls pete hegseth a.m morning says pete about start nuclear war even though haven't been attacked with nuclear weapons what will pete hegseth say will say yes sir from this perspective hegseth worst possible choice lead department defense need someone who can challenge president's thinking slow him down curb his worst impulses give him sober reasoned advice with hegseth not going happen there are other monumental decisions nuclear policy president trump will need reasoned advice not likely get from pete hegseth during campaign trump had just one clear proposal related nuclear policy build iron dome missile defense system ensure enemy can strike our homeland now this throwback former president ronald reagan's 1983 proposal called strategic defense initiative--also called star wars--to build system space ground-based interceptors make nuclear weapons impotent obsolete made for great slogans but after years some 400 billion technology still not challenge try scale iron dome cover country size united states against hundreds russian chinese long-range missiles just won't work trump could provoke new arms race even without his iron dome steroids trump's allies have called for united states build more nuclear weapons than moscow beijing combined this idea popular among conservatives heritage foundation project but let's clear expanding u.s nuclear arsenal terrible idea need treaties end nuclear arms race don't need nuclear arms race with making these weapons even more deadly even more accurate need treaties need negotiations need come together planet what should talking about building more than need waste money but also makes world more dangerous not less dangerous because provokes response from other side second guess what moscow beijing will washington suddenly builds more bombs will same third u.s buildup would doom any chances saving u.s russian arms reduction process last remaining treaty new start expires year from now unless replace treaty there will longer any legal limits united states russian warheads for first time years hear what said limits are new world now for years have had limits nuclear weapons will all gone year trump's allies are also calling for united states resume testing nuclear weapons for first time since 1992 ended nuclear testing three decades ago then signed comprehensive test ban treaty 1996 banning all nuclear tests have conducted more nuclear tests--over 1,000--than all other nations combined have need test but other nations will too like russia china beijing has only conducted nuclear tests have conducted thousand imagine how much china could learn trump gives excuse resume testing which china not doing only state world today still conducting nuclear tests north korea should pressuring pyongyang stop not reopening this pandora's box under trump could see billions dollars spent long-range missile defenses don't work end arms control start page s355 new nuclear arms race with russia china new nuclear testing all this would make world more dangerous place increase risk nuclear conflict trump asks hegseth should these dangerous things answer will yes yes yes where are going now there some possible good news too trump not surprisingly gets along well with russian president putin might end war ukraine could open path negotiate treaty follow new start president trump said just this week want see can denuclearize think it's very possible can tell president putin wants should take him should see should move direction for hegseth last thing president trump needs yes-man for secretary defense will just add one final issue national security threat climate change which pentagon which joint chiefs staff have said over over over again threat multiplier our military our ability protect world--it threat multiplier having president who climate denier coupled with secretary defense who climate denier just ignores reality world unfolding this climate era whole defense budget 900 billion hurricanes milton helene october november combined with fires los angeles right now 500 billion damage three storms half entire defense budget for our country can't have secretary defense who doesn't believe climate change threat multiplier our military security planet need someone there who can speak truth power president united states can't more strongly recommend vote floor senate this nomination unqualified his confirmation could very dangerous our nation need military personnel who respects secretary defense will have none with pete hegseth very very strongly recommend this body vote tell president come back with someone who worthy this most important

facts will lead inconvenient conclusions for his superiors president those cases where truth--not fiction not ideology--must prevail have doubts ratcliffe will able hold firm most troubling about ratcliffe were answers got from him about tulsi gabbard president trump's nominee serve director national intelligence confirmed gabbard would oversee cia our entire intelligence community think would colossally disruptive for american security there anyone who hasn't been fact based have listened her statements over years tulsi gabbard seems make things out thin air one could worse position dni

minority leader kevin mccarthy select committee resulting solely partisan exercise determined vilify president trump his advisors for january 6th breach u.s capitol whereas speaker pelosi refused selections minority leader mccarthy named only representatives liz cheney adam kinzinger select committee leaving committee with nine members rather than required thirteen whereas select committee held hearings issued subpoenas published flawed report without number members required res 503 whereas shortly before hearings began select committee named representative cheney vice chair operated

brutal murder laken riley was foreordained day joe biden took office reversed successful trump policies had finally secured our borders since day just years ago more than 7.8 million illegal aliens have been deliberately allowed into our country--a population size state washington our 13th largest state very little done vet these millions illegal migrants don't know how many terrorists violent criminals are among them worse democrats don't seem care know number terrorists are apprehending has skyrocketed violent international crime cartels violent foreign gangs are now operating freely our communities often protected from deportation detention democrats sanctuary laws one these criminals has now been convicted brutal murder laken riley how many such monsters have democrats deliberately allowed into our country not know but are slowly painfully tragically finding out victim victim this case murderer was paroled into this country through shocking abuse this power biden administration was repeatedly arrested for theft other crimes sanctuary jurisdictions each time released back onto our streets just months before laken riley's murder this murderer was arrested for theft but was released ice did not take him into custody because biden administration policy shields many criminal aliens from arrest deportation sadly this exactly what those who voted for joe biden voted for because this exactly what democrats promised fortunately those who voted for donald trump 2024 voted stop this tragic travesty our immigration laws because what has promised will begin doing over democrats objections beginning noon january during his first term president trump proved president his own authority can secure our borders president biden proved president determined undermine make mockery our immigration laws can willfully open those borders most violent criminals terrorists gangs cartels this planet use democrats sanctuary laws protect them this national nightmare will end noon inauguration day but what future presidents laken riley act would require ice detention for illegal aliens who are charged with arrested for convicted any burglary theft larceny shoplifting offense h.r further requires department homeland security issue detainer for those illegal aliens take custody them effectively expeditiously would also allow states bring civil action against derelict federal officials who refuse enforce these laws joe biden alejandro mayorkas looking this bill passed republican house march last year but senate democrats stopped cold said time today name bill laken riley tomorrow will another victim these policies another son daughter loved one won't stop until this administration stopped can only done american people thank god american people have done exactly have given this congress this president tools mandate secure our borders remove every person who has broken into our country violating our laws without this law future democratic president could once again release dangerous illegal aliens back onto our streets prey our people destroy innocent lives like laken riley's this bill would stop them speaker reserve balance time speaker pro tempore members are reminded address their remarks chair raskin speaker yield myself such time may consume speaker biden administration brought back from devastating pandemic trump economic crisis investing american workers american manufacturing american infrastructure our policies for working-class majority instead tiny rapacious billionaire class pulled our economy back from brink today our nation's economic strength envy world economist magazine put with page h55 unemployment rate 4.2 percent wages rising across america gross domestic product growing robust 3.1 percent moreover murder rate way down america unlawful immigration southern border now below where was when donald trump left office years ago roaring stock market which what trump his billionaire entourage care about just completed its strongest years quarter century now time make sure all americans enjoy benefits this astonishing economic growth should coming together today increase minimum wage lift children out poverty strengthen unions social security medicare middle class donald trump instead assembling billionaire cabinet from top 0.00003 percent wealthiest americans drawing top tier his new administration from poolside cocktail hour mar-a-lago setting broligarchs plutocrats plunder even larger share government contracts public resources trump campaigned seductive promise bringing down high post-covid-19 prices for rent groceries consumer goods healthcare but now preparing give power over economy his team globe-trotting dictator-dealing ceos billionaires very people responsible for exploiting pandemic increase prices first place doubt billionaire oligarchs have any interest bringing down cost living for working middle class america but democrats stand ready work with them after all are ones who dramatically lowered prescription drug prices medicare capping out-of-pocket monthly expenses month had constituents who were paying 500 month for insulin diabetics before capped now month capped annual total out-of-pocket expenditures for prescription drugs 2,000 year was maga republicans deep pocket big pharma who categorically vehemently opposed every step way lowering prescription drug prices medicare our colleagues now have good policy proposals for continuing lower prices have done which what campaigned all means bring proposals forward let's see them democrats have repeatedly crossed aisle hammer out bipartisan compromise last year president biden senate democrats worked with ultraconservative republican senator james lankford arrive tough bipartisan border security deal but president trump aggressively tanked deal openly expressing his preference for rallying against border crisis rather than actually developing border solution now today republicans are floor but not with their long awaited entirely missing policy solutions problems inflation immigration instead their bill today empty opportunistic measure not like compromise tanked last congress bill for greater border security better technology ports entry expanding legal pathways immigration citizenship for millions people addressing huge immigrant visa backlogs this bill would upend years mandatory immigration detention policy requiring any undocumented immigrant arrested for theft larceny shoplifting detained even are never convicted even charged with crime this radical departure from current law which since 1996 has generally required mandatory detention only for persons who are criminally convicted who admit having committed certain serious crimes--that when criminal guilt certain established beyond reasonable doubt time 1130 under this bill person who has lived united states for decades say for most her life paid taxes bought home but who mistakenly arrested for shoplifting would not free resume her life rather would detained deported even charges are dropped even police admit arrest was mistaken consider young dreamer tps recipient who with group friends after school someone group shoplifts stealing candy bar scare whole group straight everyone arrested whether were involved shoplifting not however nobody charged charges are dropped for most kids humiliating afternoon valuable life lesson but for one them young person who has been america lawfully for years with his her family consequences would devastating under this legislation--mandatory detention deportation from country just for having been arrested even never charged seems passing strange speaker our friends are taking this position when not even believe criminal justice system can trusted when jury unanimously convicts someone who has had best legal representation money can buy state new york different felony criminal counts after extended criminal trial with all due process protections including cross examination right counsel being afforded criminal justice process cannot trusted identify truly guilty person even when person has been arrested charged indicted prosecuted represented every stage given opportunity cross-examine all witnesses testify personally then unanimously convicted jury his peers beyond reasonable doubt how can criminal justice process trusted identify truly guilty person just with arrest indictment prosecution cross-examination neutral adjudication impartial judge fact-finding criminal conviction 12-person jury beyond reasonable doubt mandatory detention has always been reserved for people who are convicted crimes actually commit crimes expanding detention requirement include every person who has merely been accused arrested for even not charged for shoplifting for example collapses distinction between actual conviction serious events versus simply being charged with arrested for something very minor even charges don't even lead anywhere congress has never even appropriated sufficient resources detain all noncitizens who fall under currently serious mandatory detention categories even president trump during his first term never tried detain all migrants theoretically subject mandatory detention therefore this extremely elastic new provision adds nothing equation other than more empty rhetoric greater bureaucratic bloat bill also seeks give state governments authority control over federal immigration system trespassing article executive power way eight out nine justices supreme court completely repudiated years ago blatant violation separation powers bill seeks give state attorneys general precisely what supreme court has denied constitutional standing sue federal government court for perceived violations sections immigration nationality act states can block federal immigration policies capsizing supremacy clause expanding judicial power encroach upon executive discretion under article june supreme court united states texas emphatically rejected alleged standing states sue federal government alter government's immigration arrest policies this bill attempts legislative bypass this constitutional decision u.s texas written justice kavanaugh joined eight nine justices court rejecting states standing argument court observed among other things lawsuits alleging insufficient arrests prosecution run against executive branch's exclusive article authority enforce immigration law which includes discretion determine enforcement priorities face chronic lack resources shifting public safety public welfare foreign policy needs priorities page h56 this bill were become law both provisions would have perverse effect undermining federal government's efforts prioritize detention deportation truly most dangerous convicted felons with vastly expanded new statutory scope new authority for states get legal standing steroids government can sued state for not detaining everyone charged with not even arrested for pettiest crimes like shoplifting this bill tries give states standing sue for harms small 100 dramatically shifting power from executive branch courts federal government states both ways considered completely dubious supreme court like many immigration-related bills gop now advancing this one seems follow simple strategy pick crime paste into template immigration law covering convicted criminals then require detention deportation certain persons merely accused committing crime arrested for committing crime due process required all this allows get demonize immigrants without doing anything fix immigration system act tough without actually making america safer solving any problems within immigration laws should working together comprehensive meaningful reform colleague from california invites believe only crimes committed undocumented aliens are those who entered during biden administration well fact look hundreds thousands 500,000 crossed u.s.-mexico border first trump administration over 1.1 million people who crossed during first years his administration were eventually released from custody one people released from custody undocumented alien charged with murdering 19-year-old adam luker from alabama why don't have bill named after adam luker because inconvenient fact undocumented alien who killed him came under donald trump would hate think however can find lots cases like not what should doing here congress should seriously confronting problems serious way together rather than just trying make partisan hay out other people's tragedies their lives speaker this legislation does not move ball forward any problems facing america are being moved under closed rules without hearing without any legislative scrutiny this means member--not only just democrats but republicans too member--can offer any amendments repair gaping flaws gaps these slapdash political bills would urge our colleagues take much more serious approach here murder laken riley was unspeakable appalling crime heinous act parent family should ever have bear such calamity must take clear steps make sure people who commit crimes like this are punished full extent law trust friends agree those who commit horrific violent crimes like these must prosecuted fullest extent law this bill fails take any meaningful action improve our broken immigration system prevent crimes like this from occurring again whether undocumented aliens entered under democratic administration have republican administration have are asked vote bill fails address any real issues stake are foreclosed from offering any amendments improve this sloppy political product speaker urge all colleagues oppose this legislation reserve balance time speaker pro tempore fong members are reminded refrain from engaging personalities toward president-elect mcclintock speaker yield myself such time may consume want listen what friend just said shouldn't placing illegals detention simply for being charged with crime besides shoplifting big deal anyway listen what actually suggesting current law requires detention every illegal alien who crosses our border every one democrats have studiously ignored this law now are saying ignore this law even illegal has now been charged with committing other crimes well let them back onto streets did with laken riley's murderer few innocent teens happen get raped murdered along way well too bad democrats have told for years their refusal enforce our immigration laws because are prioritizing more dangerous offenders precisely what this bill does prioritizes dangerous offenders yet democrats are still opposing speaker yield minutes gentleman from georgia collins author this measure collins represents laken riley's hometown her grieving family this house collins speaker rise today encourage colleagues support laken riley act speaker think important record into history exactly what happened this young lady this young lady

name instead republican majority beginning this new congress right where page h57 left off last one with legislation targets scapegoats immigrants but does nothing address real problems our broken immigration system all while ignoring basic due process constitutional principles among other things this legislation would subject mandatory detention any undocumented immigrants who are merely charged with committing act theft shoplifting even are innocent this means someone merely accused shoplifting someone who might innocent who might victim mistaken identity who has not had opportunity clear his name would subject mandatory detention this bill broad would lead detention people who have committed crime have intention harming anyone flies face all notions basic due process reason both pernicious absurd where will federal government get resources detain all these people congress has never appropriated administration has ever requested sufficient resources detain all noncitizens who fall under mandatory detention categories even president trump during his first term never tried detain all migrants subject mandatory detention was far too costly even for him since this bill sweeping even dreamers people living here temporary protected status people who may have lived this country for decades shortly after their birth could subject bill's harsh provisions weren't bad enough bill also declares states have standing sue over certain immigration provisions long state its residents suffer even most trivial financial harm this appears ham-handed attempt circumvent recent supreme court rulings limiting states standing sue federal government over immigration enforcement matters merely declaring states have standing sue does not make this provision almost certainly unconstitutional unfortunately lack attention republicans pay such matters perfectly sums their entire approach immigration instead working toward serious solutions serious problems are

particular case speaker yield minutes distinguished gentlewoman from washington jayapal jayapal speaker laken riley was all accounts remarkable young woman whose life was tragically cut short horrific act should prosecuted full extent law heart goes out her family loved ones who grieve her death understand mother myself fully why face such senseless violence especially against someone young there urge something anything feel like are actually helping fix problem unfortunately this bill does nothing fix immigration system prevent future tragedies like this simply attempt score cheap political points off tragic death process unfairly sweeps many more innocent lives with due process let clear this republican playbook over over again scare people about immigrants never propose anything actually solves outdated arcane immigration system desperately needs congress allocate resources update legal pathways make immigration system work for everyone republican colleagues simply want preserve broken immigration system campaign issue can scapegoat demonize immigrants all distract american people from their real goals making working people pay for another republican tax scam benefits billionaires wealthiest just look rules package just passed out bills included not single one does anything secure border fix page h58 broken immigration system lower costs for working people address housing crisis tackle extraordinary levels income inequality this country tamp down inflation those were promises trump campaign but not single one those things actually included first bills are bringing floor without hearings let's talk about what this bill actually does this bill goes far beyond subjecting those who are convicted admit committing theft offense mandatory detention what this bill actually does subject any undocumented immigrant mandatory detention for merely being arrested charged with committing act theft larceny shoplifting along with those who are convicted who admit committing such acts under this bill daca tps recipient could subjected mandatory detention for crimes are extremely low-level for something not even crime without even having had fair day court without conviction let's clear are talking about people who have been this country for decades many congress are parents imagine your child with group kids grabbing after-school snack eleven one them chooses just snitch little candy bar off shelf shop owner calls police all kids are arrested for shoplifting your child daca recipient someone who has lived here nearly their entire life are now subject mandatory detention under this bill unfortunately there are countless real-life examples people getting wrongfully arrested for crimes didn't commit 2019 man new jersey was arrested for shoplifting trying hit police officer with car because facial recognition software falsely identified him perpetrator spent days jail even though was actually miles away from where crime was committed had been daca tps recipient this bill had been enacted would subject mandatory immigration detention even though was innocent crime which was accused people deserve have their day court are innocent until proven guilty seems something majority has forgotten doesn't seem care about unless alleged criminal president-elect upcoming administration poised bring back their no-priority immigration enforcement priority guidelines which convicted murderer would same priority for deportation undocumented mom who has been living this country for years speaker pro tempore time gentlewoman has expired raskin speaker yield additional minute gentlewoman from washington jayapal speaker imagine how much money sweeping mandatory detention proposal like this will cost federal government time when republicans are talking big game about cutting budgets but not this one why because this great boon those for-profit detention companies who make enormous profits for mandatory detention when there are far more effective cheaper ways address issue who pays for all this taxpayers even republican trifecta ice has limited resources detain remove folks however this bill like president trump's enforcement priorities seek use those resources people who committed low-level crimes even crime all makes one safer costs lot money finally this bill also bizarrely attempts give state attorneys general authority try stop administrations from carrying out important policy priorities giving them standing sue federal court under various sections immigration nationality act entire section bill

brought first place think misstatement meaning this legislation speaks very deeply what opportunistic exercise this really what gentleman was asking for law today madam speaker reserve balance time mcclintock madam speaker remind friend law also requires every illegal alien detained until their case adjudicated which what democrats have ignored these last years this bill simply says top illegal

speaker yield myself balance time close thank distinguished gentleman from california for this debate must say legislation before approach embodies reflect profound disrespect for our criminal justice system for our constitutional values begin with want change mandatory detention provisions which have had since 1996 bipartisan basis for last years have operated basis criminal conviction which obviously congruent with constitutional demands values have our country now without having legislative hearing want radically revise statutes say sufficient for somebody have been charged with arrested for offense like shoplifting theft even charges are dropped even charges are never brought after arrest made seems are backtracking from purported fidelity our constitutional values similarly want essentially overthrow justice kavanaugh's 8-1 decision united states texas from just couple years ago where supreme court determined states not have standing court say don't like way particular administration allocating its resources implementing public policy now want argue there law unconstitutional can argue but can't court simply say executive branch implementing law way particular state doesn't like yet want occasion massive shift power justice kavanaugh characterized states would essentially able control federal immigration policy still reeling from reading author this legislation's statements yesterday which think also speak fundamental disrespect for rule law which says since january hundreds peaceful protesters have been hunted down arrested held solitary confinement treated unjustly countless hours taxpayer dollars have been spent pursuing innocent grandmothers raiding president trump's home while terrorists millions illegal immigrants continue cross our nation's borders fundamentally demagogic lawless approach this whole debate have taken our body was invaded mob insurrectionists who injured 140 officers wounding them hospitalizing them cannot even acknowledge fact but instead change subject millions people crossing border illegally which over decades has undoubtedly happened under both democrats republicans what should working today madam speaker yield back balance time mcclintock madam speaker agree with colleague riot capitol years ago was abomination have said repeatedly whenever subject arises there excuse for would also remind gentleman what justice kavanaugh said united states texas where supreme court ruled states page h61 currently don't have standing sue enforce these laws what actually says was ruling was would require change law elevating facto injuries status legally cognizable injuries redressable federal court what justice kavanaugh said needed exactly what this bill does book yet democrats still oppose democratic colleagues ask them how many more laws with names attached them need pass before take this crisis seriously how many american citizens must die hands illegal aliens before all agree these tragedies are all preventable lest name child your child one attached h.r number before democrats can vote yes these commonsense bills how much more blood must shed before can all join calling for absolute end

marriage equality into law confirmed 235 well-qualified historic judges lifetime appointments--more judges than any majority has confirmed decades--and much more president biden also left america with somber warning his address--one every american should listen cautioned oligarchy taking shape america extreme wealth power influence will threaten all progress our country has made last years president biden right oligarchy beginning take shape america can see looking incoming trump administration donald trump has not even taken office yet but many his top advisers cabinet picks are extremely wealthy people with deep ties corporate special interests many these cabinet picks seem see world through eyes very rich privileged individual--a very limited vision indeed agenda are pushing--tax cuts for ultrawealthy draconian cuts working class--is narrow only furthers inequality america donald trump's agenda would precisely benefit oligarchy class president biden warning about progress have made under president biden's leadership--lower taxes for families more affordable healthcare investments infrastructure energy--should not undone only assuage desires limited few

first create contrast between parties people will see what stand for what our republican colleagues stand for support trump's nominees second hearings create record hold these nominees accountable should fail job down line--which unfortunately think many will given their meager qualifications contrast between whom democrats will fight for whom republicans will fight for becoming exceedingly obvious thanks these hearings democratic side want answers things americans are worried most about what does donald trump's agenda mean for jobs for inflation what are trump's tariffs going people's bottom lines will send prices shooting people are going ask are prescription drugs going get more expensive are going ask will our broken tax system become even more unfair under president trump way rigs system for ultrawealthy these are questions americans care about these are things democrats want answers from president trump's nominees many cases answers are very very troubling second even these nominees are confirmed end given donald trump's hold senate republicans absolute american people deserve have record can reference down line candidly many president trump's nominees are not fit for job look pete hegseth confirming some these people would reckless roll dice for our country but republicans under pressure from president-elect trump seem willing press ahead nonetheless should time come some these nominees fail job hearings are holding right now will come back haunt our republican colleagues because warnings will have been there from start asking tough questions getting nominees record establishing many these individuals are unfit these hearings will have been canary coal mine warns everyone some these nominees are too great risk democrats will continue uphold our

this coordination matter how loudly others press him embrace retreat retrenchment america cannot address grave threats our interests carte have said repeatedly there language these adversaries

his hearing yesterday president trump's nominee secretary energy his data-driven leadership creativity laid foundation for fracking boom experienced this nation has fueled american energy independence lee zeldin whom had privilege introducing earlier this morning epw committee well nominee administrator environmental protection agency lawyer veteran former star member house representatives going cut redtape going balance environmental stewardship with sensible energy production all three these nominees are excellent choices carry out president trump's all above energy strategy all have vote like most americans president trump his nominees understand energy policy foundation our nation's future our success linked directly prices pay technology create world which live unleashing american energy means lower prices means more innovation home means more safety security for our citizens well have seen before affordable reliable energy was rocket fuel for american security prosperity saw during first trump administration but over last years democrats restricted regulated tried reduce american energy production instead unlocking its full potential their america-last energy strategy policies led painfully high prices more vulnerable nation think energy was ballot this year energy fortunately president trump placing premium energy production already laying groundwork take handcuffs off american energy production day one expect president going sign blizzard executive orders bring back american energy dominance first day priorities include ending democrats electric vehicle mandate more drilling federal lands resuming exports u.s liquefied natural gas this certainly good news for home state wyoming wyoming america's energy breadbasket oil gas our bread butter have world-class reserves coal have world-class wind have benefited from american energy dominance our wyoming tough energy workers made all possible wyoming energy workers now stand ready unleash american energy once again hear colleagues other side aisle preach doom gloom about energy independence democrat leader here floor said yesterday chris wright who president's nominee for secretary energy--he called this nominee energy extremist why because chris wright believes oil gas make world round well does this depth democrats climate delusion oil gas drive our economy produce great jobs produce our prosperity because american oil gas cleaner safer more reliably than anyplace else planet earth facts could not clearer since 2005 america has been responsible for page s201 percent

clerk proceeded call roll cornyn president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered biden administration cornyn president days until president trump will inaugurated for second time president united states means only have more days president biden's absentee leadership but seems making most his final days goes out door certainly isn't letting kick him way out think most egregious example abuse power really president biden engaged now election over doesn't have stand for vote among american people--so pretty much has given them thumb eye perhaps one most egregious examples this was his pardon his son hunter december last year despite numerous efforts fbi doj protect hunter biden from accountability for his crimes president biden decided attack his own department justice say his son was selectively unfairly prosecuted well hard imagine someone thinking were unfairly targeted when entire government agencies did everything could protect him from coming justice thanks diligent careful judge who was able expose sweetheart deal would have exonerated hunter biden previously was convicted illegally possessing firearm stood charged with massive tax fraud president biden said time time again promise not going pardon him then turned around did but didn't stop there used his last days office little pardon spree granting clemency individuals well commuting sentences convicted murderers death row these people were convicted crimes ranging from conspiracy commit wire fraud mortgage fraud scheme stealing government property signing false documents bank theft participating income tax fraud misuse social security number but truth these are not victimless crimes are not sort occurrences want see happening more frequently there reason why our criminal justice system provides for accountability punishment appropriate circumstances set example for others not down path have some measure accountability which important part justice these criminals were not only people got last-minute gift from president biden january president biden announced list 19--19--new recipients presidential medal freedom this included george soros others george soros course billionaire philanthropist who has doled out billions dollars for leftwing political causes from defund police movements anti-israel organizations those who promote open borders such have experienced tragically over last four years course these are same policies have caused much suffering frustration among american people which voted believe was referendum november people voted change direction country was headed because most americans according public opinion polling felt like america was wrong path needed change course now key architect those failed policies was awarded presidential medal freedom talk about devaluing award supposed given for extraordinary service country course support rights individuals generous with their wealth america one most generous countries world think something should proud imagine how our colleagues other side aisle might act republicans honored prominent conservative philanthropist think media our democratic colleagues would applaud same way chance conservative philanthropists have been not only not given medals freedom have been subjected endless scrutiny including politically motivated subpoenas from our democratic colleagues judiciary committee just this last year but now democrats are rewarding their own with presidential medal freedom like hearing had this morning finance committee scott bessent next secretary treasury was there had listen ranking member diatribe about why important american taxpayers exposed multitrillion-dollar tax increase said this about tax cuts for wealthy but fact matter is--and nominee pointed this out--that top percent country pay vast majority income taxes but facts apparently are not all important our democratic colleagues president biden wasn't finished rewarding his friends with grants clemency presidential honors before left office also sent parting gift one his favorite beneficiaries which are radical climate activists don't doubt climate changing don't doubt humans have impact but say this end-all be-all all our policies detriment our economy job creation many other important issues just strikes misguided one consequences americans have been suffering under high prices for energy under president biden's presidency electricity prices have risen more than percent know these high prices are direct result president biden's policies which put climate activists front seat while working families are left behind but president couldn't help himself from doing more damage way out door day after christmas president biden's energy department finalized new climate regulations would functionally ban almost all natural gas-powered water heaters why would something like analysis from american gas association estimates percent customers will directly impacted rule with net cost increase since will required buy new electric water heater aga notes households affected are largely low income senior citizens fixed income who are more likely choose cost-effective water heater will now banned under rule course people want buy more expensive water heater with their own money have objection all for freedom but impose additional costs seniors who have fixed incomes other low-income families who are struggling get under high prices 40-year high inflation under biden administration simply adds insult injury but president biden didn't stop there two weeks ago biden administration gave state california permission enforce zero emissions rules for lawn mowers leaf blowers this may sound like small thing but emblematic much bigger things adds this rule page s202 would prohibit sale new equipment under horsepower kilowatts failed achieve zero emissions there home appliance device safe from this radical agenda biden administration has targeted gas-powered cars gas stoves water heaters now want get after our lawn mowers leaf blowers have said before don't have any objection anyone who wants improve their carbon footprint important them purchasing new low-emissions lawn mowers god bless them want but for working families have deal with this mandate who are just trying keep with inflation new lawn mower just might not their budget well suffice say biden administration working hard way out door wreaking havoc process president republicans are taking note know with president trump being sworn into office next monday with new majorities house senate things are going change american people voted for change are going see change--a change away from these radical policies special interest pieces legislation regulation hurt vast majority americans for benefit ideological agenda one tools are going using something called congressional review act presiding officer knows this powerful tool which allows vote congress presidential signature essentially veto administrative agency rule there timeframe believe legislative days during which can look back essentially impose legislative veto rule using this mechanism congress can review rescind regulations disapproves because course many these regulations are promulgated administrative agencies never have stand for election never have appeal voters never have explain themselves voters just what which create more more redtape regulation glad are going able focus soon after confirm president trump's cabinet congressional review act regulatory disapprovals plan introducing few these myself can reverse many biden administration's misguided regulations know other colleagues plan same thing president biden

americans was also record lows had most secure border history dangerous terrorists cartel members human traffickers weren't flooding into our country americans jobs were more secure because didn't have compete with millions foreigners who have entered country last years trying steal their jobs cost buying home was also cheaper result under president trump were energy independent this made cost living more affordable for all americans were able power american homes cars factories with reliable abundant energy those are just few domestic successes americans were benefiting from under president trump global stage finally had stability after decades foreign wars under president trump there were new wars were respected around world feared our adversaries russia didn't dare invade ukraine when president trump was office nato countries were told pay pay your bills china wasn't imposing its will south china sea across world china was contained its influence was diminishing under president trump abraham accords were signed bringing peace middle east have seen last few years achieving peace middle east was easy feat but president trump achieved did quickly united states world were harmony left couldn't stand these many successes president trump's administration was achieving home abroad pulled out all stops take him down when deep state bureaucrats globalist organizations worked together intensify covid-19 crisis same time george floyd riots erupted destroyed cities across our country liberal das politicians didn't anything stop was absolute anarchy--total chaos orchestrated leftwing politicians media antifa thugs meanwhile media tried manufacture scandal because president trump held bible front historic church while rioters burning city were ignored was all ploy take down president trump tarnish his legacy before plot take out president was full swing saw america achieving heights had never ever seen before for moment left thought had bested trump with covid sham floyd riots ultimately rigging election but after controlling biden hiding him basement then installing him president democrats were like dog who finally caught car once democrats took white house quickly realized didn't know how run country not quite like running struggle session berkeley classroom leading call for woke corporation democrats had years show country could govern more effectively than president trump but what have done what one thing have done make our country better can't think one policy one law directive actually benefited american people from day one joe biden kamala harris invited foreigners illegally enter our country weren't shy joe biden told foreigners surge border should all come while administration opened border shut down keystone pipeline making americans pay more for groceries gas biden administration engaged culture war domestically embracing far-left ideas about sexuality gender race have been told repeatedly over past years men can get pregnant democrats didn't just push woke ideology adults forced children their classrooms social media have supported biological men competing women's sports are perfectly with men sharing locker rooms showering with girls biden administration published rule would destroy title which was created protect women girls all name gender equity know not only did democrats wage war american culture weaponized our justice system going after president trump conservatives anyone who dared oppose their agenda just look how went after january protesters pro-lifers with face act parents school boards dozens illegal actions took against president trump biden administration with help congressional democrats passed bunch bills with names sound good but actually harm many americans take inflation reduction act for example one their prize bills have passed last few years was legal way launder money blue states bail them out while red states were hung out dry pumped money don't have into economy causing runaway inflation are dealing with today administration was also weak world stage appeasing every interest but interests american people this administration was committed cozying iran reinstating joint comprehensive plan action world wasn't already dangerous place why would president biden's administration agree help iran improve their nuclear facilities makes sense this administration bent over backward for nato handing over billions hard-earned american taxpayer dollars with plan ending war ukraine executed disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan left servicemembers dead with many others severely wounded this administration was basically asleep wheel who was running country well wasn't joe biden was clear from campaign didn't have mental capacity president make matters worse spent 570 days percent his presidency vacation instead white house was run committee leftwing staffers special interests who ultimately ran country into ground media democrats were

potential large fire was high midst historically dry season southern california forecasters predicted hurricane-force winds along with little humidity--essentially dry hurricane condition can imagine californians know when there red flag warning conditions are ripe for large scale fires but what came next what actually materialized would become worst natural disaster history los angeles 100 mile-per-hour winds carrying burning embers from home home multiple simultaneous fires burning more than 12,000 structures more than 40,000 acres give sense area talking about talking about nearly

presiding officer senator from california padilla suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded call roll durbin president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered 10-year anniversary passage water for world act durbin president some people chamber who served senate may remember predecessor paul simon illinois simon was ahead his time many issues including importance clean drinking water sanitation for poorest people world wrote book called tapped out autographed this copy gave 1998 many years ago certainly was not new york times best seller but paul wrote about what said was coming world crisis water what can about read this book reflected over years some years have passed how many times people talk about clean drinking water sanitation critical public health critical development sometimes are looking for big solution complex solution when simple solution first thing needed paul simon realized focusing providing clean drinking water some poorest places world can transformative understood avoid conflict between nations keep girls school reduce infant mortality improve health economic opportunity have provide people with access clean water data supports this each dollar spent clean water sanitation returns between economic health other benefits which why decided something about member u.s senate knew his family knew paul knew last thing world ever wanted was someone build statue his image for future generations but would have been happy with perhaps bill introduced entitled paul simon water for world act legislation built earlier law improve access clean water sanitation around world former representative earl blumenauer former senator bob corker republican tennessee were partners this bipartisan effort ten years ago legislation passed senate unanimously something almost unimaginable today with politics live with--but underscored true urgency importance this issue not only was page s209 this legislation right thing but made access clean water sanitation for world's poor development priority for united states result bills introduced with colleagues sustained bipartisan funding over last years american leadership has provided first-time sustainable access clean water more than million people access sanitation million can remember visit made years years ago port-au-prince haiti one poorest places earth course our hemisphere lady who medical doctor administrator clinic wanted show something had been having trouble with waterborne illness lot people were sick some children were dying said then decided build cistern pure water protect make sure village could draw from water when needed said has changed everything kids aren't dying people aren't sick things have improved dramatically walked out show sewer lid pump said got this from united states had something with man named paul simon laughed almost out loud thinking for goodness sake said how much did have invest this said 15,000 15,000 has saved lives had made difference was paul's name was happy report this incredible work want salute staffer chris homan who has traveled around africa parts asia see these investments make dramatic difference lifestyle people giving them dignity giving them life giving them future another such story from rural area ghana where these kinds programs have already eliminated waterborne illnesses can see when visited this project investment--this small investment--by united states made affordable sustainable infrastructure families can use for sanitation options safe drinking water two have hand hand this investment made project where disabled woman lives place where can find dignity name suggests for longer has crawl through snake-filled fields use river but this lifesaving work far from done climate crisis worsens industrial needs increase ensuring global access clean water supplies important ever book might not have been best seller but idea sure was sure hope continue this modest investment villages around world literally saves transforms lives around billion people this planet earth still lack access safe drinking water hope this historically important bipartisan investment will continue long into future ahead lives depend yield floor presiding officer senator from washington mrs murray president believe should able detain deport undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes took republicans their word laken riley act was necessary for need know already federal law can already detain deport immigrants who commit serious crimes are not about change but republicans have been ignoring policies already have books push for bill its current form more extreme expensive broad than first appears very concerned without serious amendments this bill rife with unintended consequences powers could abused written will drastically undermine civil liberties this country will throw our immigration system into absolute chaos undermining any president's authority shape federal policy will cost tens billions dollars here kicker will end punishing legal immigrants diverting resources from detaining true threats public safety first off let's talk about how extremely broad language this bill under this bill don't have found guilty felony detained deported huge attack due process all need arrested charged regardless whether something small shoplifting candy bar regardless whether may become clear are innocent regardless whether this happened years even decades ago even regardless whether are child let just underscore because important this bill has exemption for kids cutoff age process keep line with our general child welfare laws written this bill appears broad child could locked put plane without their parents with such sweeping language deeply concerned trump administration could abuse this law deport dreamers our farmworkers other essential workers who again may never convicted crime fair not just trump worried about because this bill open invitation for republican state officials dictate individual case outcomes regardless ice derail national immigration policy even disrupt international relations under this bill written any state attorney general could wreck major humanitarian relief pathways like temporary protected status for venezuelan ukrainian nationals can seek court orders deport individuals without signoff from ice some cases could sue halt visas from entire countries policy its design will end punishing people who are following law enter united states legally could punish refugees who are fleeing violence could punish people who come here engage trade commerce helps our economy grow could even punish american citizens are hoping get visa for their spouse with federal immigration system already too chaotic complicated just wait until any state can overrule ice undermine president throw thousands legal--legal--visa applications into limbo bill also promises these lawsuits priority which could huge burden our courts weren't counterproductive enough not only would this bill written punish legal immigrants will also divert resources need detain genuine threats our public safety ice required this bill says spend resources detaining nonviolent--not even convicted--shoplifting cases like will have their hands tied resources are stretched thinner thinner overwhelming number minor cases leaving them with fewer fewer resources then tackle most serious cases especially concerning because dhs already does not have anywhere near resources implement this bill ice would need actually more than three times current number detention beds--a 265-percent increase--for this bill would need execute removal flights week almost double its current capacity not mention would need double ground transportation all adds ice needing nearly double its staff hiring over 18,000 additional people give sense how unrealistic historically dhs hasn't been able onboard more than 1,000 people year give sense how expensive this ice estimates will need more than triple its budget year one--really closer four times their current funding level are now talking billion for this legislation over first years implement more than annual budget for entire department homeland security lot money spend bill going cause chaos punish legal immigrants undermine due process america all while drawing resources away from true threats make mistake there are serious challenges have our border there serious need for sensible immigration reform but being tough immigration does not require forsake our bedrock principles like due process our moral obligation keep children safe does not require ignore our common sense waste crucial resources page s210 while hope work with colleagues improve this bill try improve every bill can have say have long road ahead address deep concerns with way this bill threatens due process potential for abused strongly urge colleagues demand far more serious amendment process this bill but more than urge them demand serious bipartisan approach tackling immigration effective humane way one protects our country upholds our values nomination robert kennedy president very different topic wanted chance talk today about one nominees coming before because when was very young girl polio vaccine was approved this very day remember mom saying thank goodness can now send our kids school not have worry will get sick paralyzed have live iron lung worse relief was overwhelming why fear overwhelming now donald trump wants rfk jr.--an outright unapologetic anti vax conspiracy theorist--as our nation's secretary health human services now want clear will not shy about making concerns quite plain with american people part our senate's role advise consent president's nominees our job vet these nominees put them through rigorous process determine are qualified serve why met with rfk yesterday could direct with him about concerns with his anti-vaccine record could discuss other challenges our nation faces where hhs has really crucial role appreciate his time appreciate opportunity look for areas common ground but have said already oppose his nomination because regardless any other views holds his long history explicitly anti-vaccine activism utterly disqualifying not only one who worried even trump's former fda commissioner scott gottlieb has said rfk jr.'s agenda will cost lives this country mean just imagine rfk was secretary when covid struck still might not have vaccines after all called covid vaccine deadliest vaccine ever made this isn't case where can just look for areas agreement hope for best--maybe drug costs maybe healthy food are talking about conspiracy theorist who openly antagonistic public health who will have tremendous authority over americans lives their healthcare not asking too much have secretary health who believes healthy food believes vaccines especially when are already backsliding vaccines seeing real deadly consequences eliminated measles 2000 but last year had outbreaks whooping cough has spiked country home state washington polio--even polio--is making comeback these are dangerous diseases rfk would let them spread through our communities schools like wildfire any parent knows when bug goes around school doesn't stop there comes home mom dad baby brothers sisters who could serious risks here this afternoon talk some truth american people about stakes here lay out facts for anyone who might not appreciate serious threat posed rfk maybe think well not talking about vaccines like polio measles only asking questions except know this founded nonprofit entirely focused attacking vaccines rfk jr.'s nonprofit has made videos promoting falsehoods about vaccines autism sowing distrust vaccines especially among black community tried revoke emergency authorization for kids covid vaccines sued against measles vaccine requirements even amid measles outbreaks not just rfk jr.'s nonprofit should raise alarm here has said doesn't know polio vaccine caused more deaths than prevented another example hpv vaccine has led huge drop cervical cancer rfk suggested increases cancer risk let's not get cute here with excuses like well just asking questions because when says need know vaccines are safe ignoring centuries research have already done these vaccines know are safe what more has not just been asking questions these are statements going give rfk has made these are his own words has said believe autism does come from vaccines said get shot night have fever 103 sleep three months later their brain gone again said covid vaccine was deadliest vaccine ever made these statements are not just false are irresponsible are disqualifying given his track record cannot just hope rfk finally gets power undermine vaccines--a cause has way dedicated considerable time money effort will just give not believable especially when know lawyer helping him put together team has tried have different vaccines pulled from market himself--including way polio vaccine are thinking well can't really anything about vaccines need think again confirmed rfk would have tremendous power undermine vaccines could influence fda's approval medicine drugs could directly appoint people cdc's vaccine board which influences vaccine coverage costs said will fire top researchers hundreds pause infectious disease research for years--a threat far beyond vaccines would say let's not downplay fact secretary would have one biggest megaphones world spread anti-vaccine misinformation maybe are someone who thinks what have more whooping cough lot people had measles but lived realize some people probably think like because have never seen reality these terrible diseases because vaccines have been effective nurse recently shared online what whooping cough can baby what has watched families through herself will warn was soul crushing first baby can't stop coughing--not even eat not even breathe then come seizures strokes then breathing tube ventilator finally machine take over failing heart lung function then die horrific whooping cough far from only disease risk comeback don't want happen here this country around globe let's talk about measles one world's most contagious diseases easily spread coughing sneezing lingers air for hours are contagious days before develop rash days after now before vaccine millions people caught measles annually meaning thousands were hospitalized hundreds died most them young children but this not just history want know what rfk would secretary health want look samoa before samoa had measles outbreak was there--he was there propping vaccine deniers falsely blaming deaths measles vaccine after samoa had tremendous measles outbreak with over 100 hospitalized least dead mostly kids apology from him admitting was wrong instead doubled down wrote prime minister suggesting vaccines were part problem who want put charge our nation's healthcare what think going happen how many outright lies are going tolerate how many deaths before realize this nonsense dangerous look vaccine lies just scratch surface here this someone who won't accept hiv causes aids this someone who thinks chemicals water might turn people gay said this someone page s211 who thinks wireless being used control our behavior this not someone u.s senate should telling american people trust healthcare not someone should handing levers power for matter same goes for

suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll bill clerk proceeded call roll johnson president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered senator from wisconsin government spending johnson president think now have seen all kinds different versions this depressing chart total u.s debt back 1998--and will talking about year--when bill clinton was president had our first budget surplus since 1969 debt level was about 5\1/2 trillion when arrived here first year senate 2011 debt was about trillion ran quite honestly because were mortgaging our children's future will talk little bit about 2014 when president obama had certain spending level was 17\1/2 trillion recent 2019 before pandemic our debt was somewhere around 22\1/2 trillion today our debt exceeds trillion path toward much higher heights look president biden's final budget here predicting our total debt will trillion years this clearly not sustainable said this depressing reality result all debt--one many results--was devaluation dollar dollar held 1998 only worth cents today have basically cut value dollar half since 1998 2014 when president obama was president--now value dollar only worth cents value dollar prior pandemic 2019 now only worth cents why people can't afford things this inflation caused massive deficit spending--this stealth tax every american very regressive tax primarily hurts people bottom part income spectrum wealthy individuals have stocks have other assets inflate dollar devalues again this harm primarily affects lower income americans men women who work are harmed this this can't this outrage this tragedy just want ask bit hypothetical here before talk about this chart let's say are american family four are doing pretty good make spend about 100,000 year let's say next year have serious illness your family all sudden have major medical bills totaling 50,000 next year spend 150,000 well let's say get some good news medical condition now solved your family member healed what would most american families their income level stayed same--around 100,000--i don't think would keep spending 150,000 level certainly wouldn't borrow 50,000 maintain spending level would reduce their spending level back what was before illness right would back somewhere around 100,000 bucks maybe little bit more based inflation not what federal government did this know shocking most americans laying out reality situation 2019 prior pandemic total federal government spending was 4.4 trillion then had covid think very unwisely shut down lot our economy destroyed people's businesses destroyed people's lives our miserable failed response covid cost lot money washington went massive spending spree year pandemic spent actually closer 6.6 trillion now again would have been like normal family once pandemic passed would have returned some reasonable spending level but didn't last years now spent average 6.5 trillion 2.1 trillion more than spent 2019 there justification for this last year spent total 6.9 trillion 2.6 trillion 2.5 trillion higher than 4.4 trillion again there justification for question have been asking how return reasonable prepandemic spending level will guarantee people who voted for president trump not expect federal government going continue spending president biden's democrats who have been charge their spending levels this unacceptable unsustainable what have done have laid out couple different options here again will use another analogy let's say same family four was talking about with income 100,00 let's say have baby now their population their family size has increased percent think most people recognize family four could increase their income percent from 100,000 125,000 then tack amount for inflation--let's say percent inflation--up 128,750 think most people would recognize now family has been kept whole have been made whole have been able maintain their standard living well think same thing would true for federal government for americans living within america know looking different benefits federal government bestows americans extracts our hard-earned tax dollars went back number different years prior pandemic went back 1998 again was first year actually had budget surplus since 1969 how irresponsible government has always been but back 1998 what magic moment actually had budget surplus was under bill clinton spent 1.7 trillion obviously too low because have had inflation because have had population growth what have done each one these scenarios here have taken basic spending levels have increased them based population growth inflation plus exempt social security medicare interest have plugged president biden's budget amounts for social security medicare interest result analysis for 1998 for bill clinton's spending level--i don't think anybody would really argue bill clinton spent too little 1998--if did increase would based population inflation plus use today's social security medicare interest expense would end with 5.5 trillion now not secret reason chose 1998--i looked all these page s212 years doing with 1998 spending levels compare president biden's budgeted revenue for this year which has not decreased because tax cuts jobs act--the revenue has consistently increased 5.5 trillion--we would have balanced budget what everybody says impossible achieve going back bill clinton's spending levels increasing them population inflation using today's social security medicare interest expense would balance budget wouldn't have increase debt ceiling wouldn't experiencing threatened more inflation too reasonable for washington let's look another scenario let's take look barack obama's--president obama's--spending levels 2014 again don't think president obama was spending too little 2014 was here was spending too much but take his 2014 levels inflate them population growth since then inflation using today's social security medicare interest would spending 6.2 trillion this year pretty reasonable not balanced budget but whole lot better than 6.9 7.3 trillion president biden budgeted for this year--a far more reasonable spending level but don't like just too reasonable too aggressive for just back 2019 when spent 4.4 trillion increase population growth inflation using president biden's social security medicare interest would 6.5 mean think completely unacceptable has been average increase 2.1 above 4.4 trillion would still whole lot better than president biden's 7.3 trillion last year's spending 6.9 trillion how can anybody justify spending this level when were only spending 4.4 trillion years ago here what suggesting set those other scenarios aside president trump was just elected again don't think anybody certainly not voted for president trump was not expecting president trump not expect him come into office accept spend president biden's levels would encourage president trump back take look final budget proposed for fiscal year 2021 look his estimate for spending have done exact same thing using fiscal year estimates from his last budget but using this year's social security medicare interest expense are looking spending level trillion again can look individual expense items can take look defense don't think are spending enough too risky world mean somewhere within range 5.5 which would literally balance our budget 6.2 trillion reasonable base ought include budget will passing this year should drive future spending would reset spending levels far more reasonable level again let just reemphasize whether use bill clinton's 1998 spending level which would result 5.5 trillion baseline barack obama's 2014 spending levels which would result baseline budget 6.2 trillion president trump's final budget which would result trillion spending level reasonable approach what families what businesses america are forced don't just say spend whatever want put percent our spending budget automatic pilot will never look will just spend whatever want how bankrupt family how bankrupt business how are mortgaging our children's future has stop putting everybody notice budget committee finance committee going insist budget pass now republicans are control senate returns some reasonable baseline listen reasonable will negotiate not saying this gospel this etched stone but president trump our majority leader our majority leadership house leadership are going have justify how would justify spending more than these reasonable baselines ran 2010 because were mortgaging our children's future remember doing parades shouting are mortgaging our children's future immoral has stop are spending percent gdp federal government level not vision our founding fathers sovereign states where government primarily state level local level where close people where more efficient more effective more accountable now washington gobbling all our resources borrowing these vast amounts money devaluing our currency are not solving problems are not reducing poverty are not making lives better are putting american lives risk government grows our freedoms recede americans have understand all things have made this country great men women who have worked built this marvel nation one essential ingredient have always used just freedom freedom allowed them dream aspire build create this marvel country freedom will allow these young people sitting front here same thing but long government continues grow those freedoms will necessarily recede direct relationship have allowed government grow way too large influences far too much our lives negatively influences need jealously guard our freedom need jealously reclaim our freedom best way shrink size scope cost government its influence over our lives only way have reduce total spending federal government this metric talk about all kinds things metric one final point are not going able tax our way out this don't have taxation problem have spending problem want make final comment refuting false narrative hear nauseam from other side tax cuts jobs act did not cause our deficits when cbo scored score time passed was was going reduce revenue increase our deficits 1.5 trillion cbo then after passage think april 2018 projected out revenue for years take look revenue from 2018 2024 actually have actual results projected about trillion worth revenue over 7-year period actual amount revenue raised from 2018 2024 was 28.7 trillion beat cbo's estimate 1.7 trillion original score 1.5 trillion--it was--in years actually beat their estimate 1.7 paid for tax cut years plus 200 billion had severe covid recession middle don't believe anybody tells tax cuts jobs act caused our deficits didn't paid for themselves less than years then some have spending problem this country there justification for going from 4.4 trillion 6.5 trillion now are 6.9 with end sight this immoral what are doing our children have got get this under control this about good rationale good justification for setting some dollar limit using budget process unlike have ever used before not just for being able pass some kind reconciliation package with mere majority vote but actually use budget way american families american businesses set spending limits then ask our committees chair our committees take those budget caps seriously figure out how can structure spending how can structure these programs actually live within those budget caps again actually used bill clinton's 1998 spending level inflate way have done here actually balance budget what people who came out november voting for president page s213 trump their goal their expectation suggest live their expectations yield floor presiding officer ricketts

our accomplishments had responsibility for errors great deal with accomplishments thank for doing your job well--pretty good for mizzou grad yield floor presiding officer senator from oregon unanimous consent requests--amendments merkley president have come floor talk about impact laken riley bill upon children here united states america suggest have debate over several amendments designed how more appropriately treat our children who reside here united states not end doing significant injury them which very much believe going result proceed without some changes but let start just noting thoughts are--as think thoughts every senator are--with laken riley's family whenever there tragedy--no tragedy should happen whether perpetuated citizen perpetuated immigrant americans should safe their communities absolutely clear need comprehensive commonsense immigration reform here senate democrats republicans worked together back page s214 2013 pass just such bill--an enormous investment border security years ago approved this body democrats republicans together bill never got hearing house representatives hope will fact try resurrect spirit inspired years ago this coming year for comprehensive reform this particular bill very troubling how impacts children troubled bill such consequence quite frankly legal complexity was brought floor without going through committee really here senate way responsible work complicated consequential bills have them before committee committee can bring all experts necessary resolve disputes misunderstandings about how bill might work from common understanding needed reforms can implemented but here floor senate where often only one two are here time there such consideration can't bring experts floor here resolve these issues colleague from alabama here today when propose consider certain amendments anticipate going object although will try persuade her otherwise with logic presentation but would say core point stands this bill consequential complicated potential impact children dramatic let's work prevent something really awful from happening here our country because know not intent colleague this bill written requires ice officers detain individuals who have neither been charged nor convicted crime--neither charged nor convicted children imprisoned without being charged convicted crime--that what this bill does current system children can fact detained but discretion front end discretion back end understand whole circumstances individual flight risk does individual pose risk community are talking about assault with deadly weapon are talking about grabbing eating apple while walking down aisle grocery store discretion obliterated this bill 5-year-old girl either our states--i from oregon senator britt from alabama--gets hungry grabs apple laken riley act says young girl arrested must put into ice prison--must without discretion--and there provision bill get girl out there required review this obliteration everything understand about due process child arrested but never charged because there was fact end evidence--no conviction because since there evidence there trial--is still sitting prison without recourse ice prison this not america know don't believe this america colleagues across aisle want come here say let's work together fix this bill what are looking today have three amendments will explain each amendments before ask unanimous consent set aside pending amendment amendment can fact debated voted first amendment excludes children from this bill idea mandatory detention should apply adults then let's exclude children children would still subject potential detention exists under current law discretion--in fact under current law can detained with discretion even just for arrest before have been charged convicted but there discretion involved know case which there has been permanent mandatory imprisonment child who has only been arrested never charged never convicted entire history united states america are about change wrong president ask unanimous consent set aside pending amendment can offer amendment there minutes for debate amendment upon use yielding back time senate vote amendment without further intervening action debate presiding officer there objection presiding officer senator from alabama mrs britt reserving right object president with all due respect colleague from oregon voted against even proceeding this bill now attempting force amendments onto bill outside bipartisan amendment process are working through look get understand frustration when your caucus working your bill doesn't get called voted but truth are working diligently make sure all voices are heard also find really interesting because for past years under failed biden-harris administration's open border policies have not seen one bill brought floor from this side aisle really focus what happening children result these policies look our wide-open border have had over 468,000 unaccompanied children come across our border last years when look numbers hhs has put out admit losing least 85,000 children where has outrage been colleagues this side aisle have been diligently bringing this forefront time time again even holding our own version hearing because couldn't get our democratic colleagues shine light this how dare step out line with biden harris their open border policy agenda how dare should have did will continue make sure speak for these kids when look what happening migrant children being trafficked many cases from drug trafficking sex trafficking stories are absolutely gut-wrenching heartbreaking something has done begins with making sure have accountability are taking criminals off our streets not just migrant children who have paid price for failed policies this last administration american children well look 12-year-old jocelyn nungaray texas who was brutally raped murdered two men who never should have been here look laken riley who last friday would have celebrated her 23rd birthday had still been this earth had this bill been enacted laken riley would still alive this bill lifesaving bill this bill protects children are going continue fight expose detrimental impact biden-harris open border policies this side aisle look forward joining with those other side aisle who are willing make commonsense targeted reforms keep americans safe because object presiding officer objection heard senator from oregon merkley colleague laid out quite set factors there but let's not blur picture picture this child came here when were months old have been here for years walk out store with group children police officer thinks saw them put something into their pocket arrests them turns out didn't put anything into their pocket nothing was there but have been arrested now ice required indefinitely imprison child--that child alabama who was going great outstanding member their school their community--sentencing child with charge conviction crime prison know exactly what harm type imprisonment does what this amendment about can't take all other issues but will say last year had bipartisan group develop comprehensive bill colleagues across aisle blocked from coming floor but was last year's debate this bill has purpose but don't think purpose wrongly indefinitely mandatorily imprison innocent children would ask colleague while are objecting now let's continue this conversation because important fairness america page s215 there legal difference opinion currently just going describe was sold house side saying there settlement called flores settlement which will continue protect children prevent this from happening--an innocent child indefinitely detained prison with review process but let's turn counsel for flores counsel for flores has put out detailed statement have copy understand other lawyers may have other opinions but these are experts say flores settlement does not apply undocumented children community applies only children detained federal immigration custody dhs under customs border protection immigration customs enforcement certain circumstances forth neither flores settlement nor any other existing legal protection would prevent undocumented children from being mandatorily detained ice under laken riley act currently written goes note explain flores settlement consent decree law federal law trumps consent decrees goes say children including toddlers are not exempted from laken riley act states have minimum age for prosecuting children meaning can arrested any age even toddler will ask colleague not again consider granting consent for this amendment but would ask work with explore this topic see can fix this problem our mutual satisfaction don't harm children would consider doing mrs britt will always work with talk about how can help children--always merkley thank are same hallway over hart building mrs britt neighbors merkley look forward cooperating many topics but this perhaps most important one moment second amendment have creates some flexibility exists current law doesn't exist under this bill requires dhs employ what referred best interest standard for child this standard used virtually every single state foster care child service industry amendment reads--it nice have very short amendments requires dhs only detain children manner consistent with best interest child does not abrogate modify replace protections for children applicable federal law regulation court orders decrees--in other words preserving flexibility exists current law which means could detained but judge can consider totality circumstances level crime whether not there flight risk whether not there potential harm community best interest standard seems like appropriate thing apply when are fact collectively striving for best interest children ask unanimous consent set aside pending amendment may offer amendment there minutes for debate amendment upon use yielding back time senate vote amendment without further intervening action debate presiding officer there objection senator from alabama mrs britt president reserving right object have repeatedly confirmed with ice all existing consent decrees would continue apply this amendment addresses something bill doesn't have said laken riley act would protect kids bipartisan targeted common sense why want keep way object presiding officer objection heard senator from oregon merkley president disagree with colleague because this bill eliminates flexibility current system consider totality circumstances restoring best interest standard every state intimately familiar with remedying lack flexibility bill written but again will continue this conversation view coming floor having this dialogue kind way for something too rare--way too rare--here senate rarely have these types conversations front american people think important have them especially when there some value--that maybe share same value but have different interpretations how value will impacted sure share same value trying not kids wrong why value this dialogue with colleague hope will lead opportunity resolve these issues have third amendment third amendment related another aspect way children are affected including american citizen children imagine parent who goes work who accused--i don't know--of stealing tool out factory arrested arrested now under this bill adult has locked up--no flexibility front end--even though turns out did not steal tool had nothing their bag had with them officer thought did didn't never get charged never get convicted there trial are charged but parent who has maybe one two three four american citizen children home waiting for them--they come home from school parent comes home have locked under this bill are not just talking about impact this bill immigrant children are talking about impact citizen children now care about both but just want note there has been conversation about this bill only affects immigrants affects american citizens too affects spouses who might american citizens certainly affects children who are likely american citizens this amendment says adult with children under subject mandatory detention currently has end back end has ability appeal--it permanent detention permanent imprisonment--that have children home after days there would court proceeding consider whether not conditions should exist for release after normal set issues are considered such this person danger community this person flight risk can released with bail--the same things have now--because back home are bunch children maybe noncitizen children maybe citizen children but bunch children who are going parent never came home not just latchkey kid with parent coming home p.m because when their shift ends kid who doesn't know what hell now life has been shattered this would create opportunity for flexibility exists current law after days mandatory detention think appropriate way address potential for impact sure one intended writing this bill which was leave bunch children back home with parent support president ask unanimous consent set aside pending amendment can offer amendment there minutes for debate amendment upon use yielding back time senate vote amendment without further intervening action debate presiding officer there objection senator from alabama mrs britt president reserving right object have heard lot things are untruthful about this bill today first off one's due process taken with regard their immigration proceeding may moving ability see criminal proceeding through end end day have make decision decision front colleagues right now are going protect open border policies are going protect kids mean are seeing even this conversation about carveouts page s216 whatnot--you have got teen migrant gangs running rampant new york city allegedly running theft rings with children young think about what when think about each one these things have discussed today were carve out certain kid certain age don't make kid safer make them greater target for drug cartels for people looking move crime have make sure are taking commonsense approach this end day don't commit crime are going good here today say time pass laken riley act past time that--having commonsense targeted approach does not fix everything hear colleague's frustration with regard regular order last year would like echo think about what are dealing with right now have had over million people come across border under biden-harris administration some people say number much higher there are least million came across border don't know who are where are going what their intentions are look nondetained docket have here our country--7.8 million look those who have been given their due process--1.4 million have been issued their final orders removal meaning have been given their due process have said have legal right here have got better tackling every bit doing better starts today are not only going right laken riley her legacy are going right children this country making safer more secure exactly what this bill does bipartisan piece legislation must keep strong keep way president object presiding officer objection heard senator from oregon merkley president was hoping those last two words weren't object but this important issue has been raised need look carefully because there intention leave houseful children home alone when parent poses flight risk has committed crime poses risk community those children are being harmed fact take factual dispute with few colleague's points noted due process had been taken when eliminate discretion front end change due process judge can longer say this person flight risk risk community has children home will put high bond will absolutely show know where all their relatives are will best because person subsequently charged will there for trial due process stripped away front end there due process existence now back end where person can challenge their detention whether not should there fact during previous trump administration there were children who were released with such challenges but taken away yes due process dramatically changed with huge impact children colleague mentioned don't want children targeted for gangs amen who more target for gangs than children left alone home because their parent has been unjustly imprisoned does exactly opposite what colleague wants achieve know this conversation will continue least hope will are now under filed cloture motion which means majority intends close debate probably monday yet one democratic amendment has been heard--one majority leader has said wants things differently wants there amendment process amendment process saw when first came this senate consisted standing saying have relevant germane amendment asking for existing amendment set aside mine can brought which puts queue for consideration people can study then whole series votes all those things are queue did this dodd-frank did this obamacare think should here because consequences are high but can't done then would ask colleague who has worked hard this particular bill take look whether republican side will agree hear these amendments vote them may voted down but think are important think extremely important kids not wrapped this can currently detained but with discretion circumstances think particularly important have standard for children terms their best interest think particularly important have way after few weeks have some look whether children who have been left home alone--and circumstances are appropriate there flight risk circumstances are appropriate there community risk--to help address situation are harming children this was never meant harm ask for republican colleagues consider providing opportunity because they--it takes 100 percent every single senator has agree hear amendment used have senate code senate code was won't object your amendment don't object mine are topic before these are topic before these are not some crazy thing these are addressing core due process issues affect children would ask least get some discussion for possibility consideration thank colleague from alabama for coming hearing out well as--i not really thanking for objecting but thanking spirit which think want right thing will keep striving convince right thing here should debate these amendments presiding officer senator from alaska tribute

trump's presidency moments after taking oath office president trump declared was dawning golden age here america but day one into his presidency clear donald trump's golden age not for working middle class his golden age rather for special interests wealthy elite corporate insiders promised take president just look his first day white house which shows exactly what saying day one president trump his executive orders made harder for americans save prescription drug costs president trump cleared way for big oil polluters halted leasing offshore wind farms took steps make harder enroll aca made medicaid less generous removed united states from paris climate accords nothing president did day one lowered grocery prices nothing helped americans achieve their dream owning home nothing will help working families earn more save more their drug costs will cost buying maintaining home will cost healthcare will cost energy will who exactly donald trump's golden age for not for working americans for sure president trump's golden age one for america's biggest drug companies who can now worry less about lowering their prices golden age for america's richest oil executives who want nothing more than kill clean jobs deepen america's dependence fossil fuels golden age for america's top percent who want another trillion-dollar tax break paid for backs workers middle class sadly golden age for lawlessness lawbreakers who were pardoned yesterday president trump there other way describe president trump's pardon january offenders than american let's clear president trump didn't just pardon protesters pardoned some people convicted assaulting police officers seditious conspiracy betrayal highest order our capitol police officers who risked their lives keep safe when president trump talks about golden age talking about golden age for drug companies powerful oil executives rioters who attack our police attack our democracy not golden age americans want nominations president nominations this week senate will continue exercising its constitutional duty offer advice consent president's nominees last night senate unanimously confirmed our former colleague senator rubio secretary state even though senator rubio democrats differ many issues was clear was very well qualified for job deserved confirmation now every one president trump's nominees were qualified experienced senator rubio would sail through senate with bipartisan support but sadly too many president's nominees not match senator rubio's caliber too many have troubling backgrounds too many seem unprepared for job proved during testimony too many nominees have been rushed through before their paperwork has been submitted senator rubio was thorough quick with his background checks documentation did right way but too many other nominees have delayed dragged their feet wrong try rush them through too many president's nominees seem more interested pushing ultraright's extremist agenda than fighting for working middle-class families later today will meet with president trump's nominee for omb director russell vought vought one most troubling nominees president trump has selected about ultraright come during our meeting hope get clarity simple question who will vought fight for confirmed american people project which americans have already rejected look forward our conversation because believe important both sides hear directly candidly from president's nominees before are asked vote their nomination after all debate over president trump's nominees not just about senior-level positions administration debate nominees debate about president's very agenda about who will benefit whose side are these nominees president trump promised agenda will fight for working middle class promised golden age for country but actions speak louder than words far president's nominees suggest there any golden age coming only one for very very elite democrats will continue get president's nominees record very important questions will donald trump's nominees focus cutting costs will more interested cutting sweetheart deals for big businesses will protect our communities will focus more protecting special interests will serve middle-class working families will serve swamp what american people want know yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll legislative clerk proceeded

all these people were among roughly 1,500 january insurrectionists who president trump pardoned last night what happened claims party being favor law order even president trump's own vice president said last week--the senator from state ohio committed violence january obviously shouldn't pardoned didn't apply last night all people just described were pardoned president trump for their actions

enforcement officer don't all one judiciary committee republican colleagues actually criticized last week for even asking question here what said find hard believe president united states would look facts were used convict violent people january 6th say was just intemperate moment it's absurd unfair hypothetical action president trump unfair but unfortunately longer hypothetical these law

literally risking their lives for every single day what was message last night pardoning people who assaulted them january 2021 page s265 some people died result attack every american should appalled

president sworn was want express personal congratulations along with millions people across country president trump our former colleague j.d vance have told people when j.d vance came senate actually had met him before because when went yale law school actually was intern judiciary committee serve worked office for very brief period time didn't know him then told him knew him before was famous

hillbilly elegy''--about circumstances under which j.d vance was raised--you can see has overcome lot obstacles life served u.s marine know was celebrating last night with ohio state championship being graduate school was great see him get sworn yesterday well again only america--only america--can something like happen immigration secret either last years biden administration's policies have been nothing but disaster for nation state has been more negatively affected than state state texas have 1,200 miles common border with mexico open border policies biden administration have been unmitigated disaster from public health standpoint public safety standpoint many our border communities have simply been overwhelmed overrun just sheer volume people coming from all around world this not sort immigration have seen past where poor people have come united states across border work send money home literally have seen with biden open border policies people from all around world show claim asylum paroled into interior united states which like blinking green light anybody everybody who wants come america knowing would released under biden administration's policies have seen millions nobody really knows for sure how many millions people come basically move into united states outside our legal immigration program which think very important but there are also roughly million think got-aways''--people evading law enforcement--and can only imagine what are know there was reason evade law enforcement under biden administration didn't have criminal record weren't good because knew would released only was logical--it only made sense--that these were people who were either carrying drugs had criminal records were otherwise engaged antisocial activities like said think maybe about million those people made their way into interior united states one most important ways president trump began with his signature these executive orders beginning yesterday was reverse policies biden administration get our country back track securing our southern border this border crisis indicated one president biden himself practically invited invited--during his first campaign when encouraged migrants immediately surge border mean this crazy talk think about but what said course this perhaps one campaign promise president biden actually kept early months 2021 president biden appointed vice president harris--we all remember this--as his border czar well tasked her with role managing this growing surge migrants even back then early stages what was become historic humanitarian disaster some expressed concerns harris might not task but when was made aware made answer for her lack qualifications hadn't actually been border specifically fact hadn't been there kamala harris made light question with famous quip said haven't been europe don't understand point you're making somebody pointed out hadn't been border said haven't been europe didn't understand point well everybody else got even didn't was singularly unqualified bore this out think her service border czar was singularly unqualified border czar took another months for her accomplish her one only visit texas-mexico border can tell said texas has 1,200-mile common border united states has 2,000-mile common border not every piece border same arizona california new mexico many those places are very different from border with texas mexico but this one visit border texas vice president harris steered clear ground zero surge illegal immigration which rio grande valley was epicenter border crisis yet was no-show instead traveled paso--which another border town but very very different--for sanitized made-for-tv visit add insult injury vice president visited texas multiple times last summer fundraise campaign for president but didn't take time border all but this should come surprise because seemed completely disinterested performing any function border czar under her negligent watch surge beginning president biden's presidency only went from bad worse biden-harris administration presided over daily weekly monthly records illegal crossings across border customs border protection federal agency responsible has tracked more than million encounters across nation under president biden's leadership including 8.7 million southern border more than 400,000 unaccompanied children--to this one scandals really hasn't gotten adequate attention--400,000 unaccompanied children have been encountered border placed with sponsors united states now biden administration resisted any sort background checks sponsors matter fact placed these children with other illegal immigrants country homes where didn't know whether there were either gang members people with records sex offenders for example sad truth these children like million other migrants came across page s266 border ended united states courtesy cartels criminal organizations get rich smuggling people into united states but don't just smuggle people smuggle drugs other contraband too but these children particular once arrive united states many them are exploited treated indentured servants until pay back debt owe their traffickers those are lucky ones others are trafficked for sex recruited into gangs neglected don't know biden administration couldn't tell whether these children were going school getting healthcare need like matter fact said have responsibility responsibility state child welfare organizations know are overwhelmed here are 400,000 more children are dumped into their hands result shelter facilities becoming increasingly crowded biden administration rushed placement process these children now has completely track least 85,000 those unaccompanied minors according new york times investigative story where actually followed calling sponsors only get answer knocking door nobody would come door don't know--they don't know--what happened these children also know cartels are getting richer trafficking drugs mentioned including fentanyl synthetic opioid which very different from heroin cocaine which require lengthy process growing plant then processing drug cartels are selling fentanyl which uses chemical precursors come from china then mexico are mixed then pressed look like pharmaceutical drug but are counterfeit drugs killed more than 70,000 people last year alone this drug comes across southern border with very little well just don't know how much actually makes its way across know how much interdicted but could just fraction number actually makes its way across border here tragic statistic this leading cause death for young people between age america have been numerous high schools texas where grieving parents said well our child ate dinner dinner table then next morning went found him her dead her room--having taken something thought was relatively innocuous drug only find out hard way was laced with fentanyl which took their life well our border patrol has simply been overwhelmed volume people coming across border because there such thing deterrence one things about law enforcement learn enforcing law can discourage other people from violating law actually enforcing border security can deter people from coming first place but without deterrence under biden administration border patrol has simply been overwhelmed with historic numbers people attempting cross successfully crossing have not gotten support need handle magnitude challenges face every day men women who serve border patrol are heroes are loyal patriotic americans who put uniform what their government has asked them until are told have tie one hand behind your back can't actually your job because just have welcome people into country can't keep people out who are violating law going extend gratitude men women who serve border patrol well national border patrol council which has been enormously helpful credible source what actual conditions have been along border american people can know how bad has gotten national border patrol council has been our partner friend helped senator cruz have welcomed many our colleagues border can see firsthand what have learned result our many times visiting there particularly want express gratitude jason owens who outgoing border patrol chief even when administration did not provide adequate support handle this historic crisis jason had backs men women border patrol but good news under president trump all our border patrol agents will start receiving support need deserve from federal government president trump used his first day office make number actions addressing this crisis declared this historic ongoing crisis national emergency which designated cartels smuggle people drugs into country foreign terrorist organizations directed departments state homeland security resume migrant protection protocols otherwise known remain mexico program people who want come united states legally through asylum system can't come interior united states simply released have remain mexico await processing their claim for asylum this will course deter economic migrants from making this dangerous journey having them await their asylum hearings mexico same time president directed department homeland security stop catch-and-release ask border patrol how explain all this this huge mass humanity this tsunami people coming across border say there are consequences for coming illegally under biden administration one those incentives for people continue come employing catch-and release policy because without detention are never going stop flow this was primary pull factor migrants under biden administration president trump also terminated biden administration's unlawful cuban-haitian-nicaraguan-venezuelan parole program parole word people may familiar with criminal context where people can paroled out prison this little different immigration context this means individuals who meet certain select criteria can released into interior united states but supposed done hardship case-by-case basis biden administration completely transformed parole doing categorically other words said 30,000 migrants per month are allowed released united states come from cuba haiti nicaragua venezuela 360,000 year just released into interior united states not done case-by-case basis violated law congress put place but biden administration didn't really seem care about what law was were going what wanted pleased president trump has directed department homeland security department justice completely fulfill requirements dna fingerprint act 2005 bill former senator from arizona senator jon kyl worked enact under law department homeland security will protect americans from dangerous criminal illegal immigrants collecting dna samples from migrants apprehended border many instances can just cheek swab but dna allows positively identify people who may criminal aliens president trump's order department homeland security verify relationships claimed family units apprehended border will help put end cartels child trafficking biden administration policies enabled because cartels are smart knew what policies were family unit--that adult child--came together were treated little bit differently but found out hard way cartels would simply hire out these children adults could get into country claiming family unit again more child trafficking child abuse will president trump's order department homeland security verify page s267 these relationships will help put end cartels child trafficking which biden administration enabled pleased president trump has also ended use customs border protection one app this was app could download your phone allowed migrants more quickly efficiently cross open border under biden administration could simply make appointment using this app your phone meaning federal government would facilitate your entry into united states quicker basis really bizarre think about but gave cartels other ways make money selling appointments had made app was obviously hijacked cartels who are not dumb--they are smart--and are driven profit motive glad president trump made border security day one priority his administration look forward continuing work with him help improve safety for communities all across texas all across nation but also thrilled president trump has chosen new u.s border patrol chief texan mike banks people may have heard mike banks before because was governor abbott's border chief mike brings incredible credentials this job while vice president made only one trip texas-mexico border during her entire tenure mike former border patrol agent has got vast experience border

indicated governor abbott had selected him serve texas border czar mike has also served u.s navy military police have had privilege getting know mike know his qualifications his experience his competence his firsthand experience dealing with challenges our border have doubt will make outstanding 27th head u.s border patrol look forward working with him president trump secure our borders

into united states same time facilitated collapse our southwest border president biden vice president harris abandoned any semblance interior immigration enforcement september 2021 memo biden-harris administration made enforcement more difficult for immigration customs enforcement officers training materials obtained judiciary committee published staff report last year dhs failed answer seemingly clear-cut questions such whether alien who served page h192 20-year drug-related prison sentence alien who discharged firearm outside police station should priorities for arrest deportation until trump administration can change them those are training materials required for all ice's enforcement personnel nationwide instead making clear ice officers should carry out their duties remove criminal aliens from american streets biden-harris administration instructed ice officers develop full profile criminal alien before deciding whether arrest someone who country illegally training examples included determining whether illegal alien has high blood pressure caregiver biden harris administration's immigration absurdity appears know bounds transcribed interview with judiciary committee former top ice official admitted biden-harris administration's policies have made immigration enforcement more dangerous for ice officers more difficult carry out less efficient overall ice official even acknowledged because border crisis fewer ice officers are available track down public safety national security threats because are left border administration-related tasks consequences these policies are not hypotheticals simply numbers are reality for families across country are emblematic biden-harris administration's war women last september judiciary committee heard from three mothers whose daughters were brutally assaulted murdered illegal aliens welcomed into country president biden vice president kamala harris tammy nobles recounted how joe biden kamala harris released

was placed alternatives detention joe biden kamala harris immigration legacy more unvetted aliens released into american communities more criminal aliens american streets more americans endangered radical reckless policies thankfully american people have voted end this nightmare preventing violence against women illegal aliens act just one many bills republicans have proposed will help close immigration loopholes reverse disastrous policies biden harris administration implement president trump's immigration enforcement agenda preventing violence against women illegal aliens act makes crystal clear illegal aliens who commit sex offenses are inadmissible removable from united states bill also fixes discrepancy current law creating ground inadmissibility for domestic violence mirror existing ground removability for same offenses addition h.r expands current ground removability for domestic violence cross-referencing existing statutory definition for sex offenses although many aliens can already found inadmissible removable from united states for certain sex offenses domestic violence offenses this bill expands clarifies conduct for which alien can found removable from country time now take seriously danger criminal aliens united states anything makes easier for adjudicators officials ensure criminal alien's arrest removal should receive overwhelming bipartisan support particularly when comes sex offenses domestic violence speaker urge colleagues support h.r preventing violence against women illegal aliens act reserve balance time raskin speaker yield myself such time may consume delighted here with with gentlewoman from florida speaker america's immigration laws are like admissions policy for country how get into america who gets kicked out america for what reasons our immigration laws today will get kicked out deported from country commit rape other sex offenses domestic violence indeed any other crime violence law today are convicted are deported are out has been law for decades america time 0930 our immigration law establishes similar policy way provides anyone seeking admission america who has committed violent sex offense crime domestic violence inadmissible our country since 1930s case law has made perfectly clear rape domestic violence sexual battery are all crimes involving moral turpitude which make perpetrator inadmissible america has been law our country for decades what does h.r add committing sexual assault domestic violence will already render deportable inadmissible under our laws why need create another section law doing same thing necessary redundant course its being redundant unnecessary may not sufficient reason vote against bill after all cheerfully admit this body under stewardship our friends passes lot unnecessary redundant legislation house just send message say perhaps this what our friends set out today pass another simple messaging bill complication today this way this messaging bill actually written will create big problems for many many victims domestic violence why more than 200 national state local groups advocating for victims rape survivors domestic violence people across america should listening today strongly oppose bill our colleagues have brought forward national task force end sexual domestic violence sent letter urging reject h.r urge every single member congress read this letter carefully before vote this bill groups fighting domestic violence warn this legislation can ultimately have devastating consequences for immigrant victims domestic violence page h193 signers this letter include range national groups like ywca national council jewish women afl-cio coalition labor union women dozens state local groups like california partnership end domestic violence colorado coalition against sexual assault maryland coalition against sexual assault mississippi coalition against domestic violence catholic charities omaha nebraska dozens dozens more from states across country please read this letter these are groups working change law culture stop rape domestic violence our country but see this poorly drafted legislation would end harming untold numbers victims domestic violence themselves putative beneficiaries act here why when comes crimes involving moral turpitude there are exceptions law protect domestic violence victims who often get swept very laws designed protect them anyone who has ever been prosecutor public defender this chamber knows common for abusers accuse their victims domestic violence themselves assault sometimes truthfully often falsely any event well known victims get arrested prosecuted sometimes even convicted simply for defending themselves fighting back against their abusers rapists here real-life example drawn from domestic violence survivor advocacy groups opposing their legislation young woman student visa here was trapped abusive relationship her estranged boyfriend tried rape her fought back biting his ear drawing blood then called police report rape but upon seeing boyfriend's injury officers also arrested female victim whose language skills kept her from comprehensively explaining what had happened point spent several days jail was ultimately convicted misdemeanor domestic violence but judge sentenced her time served once got lawyer translation services which allowed context violent abuse had been enduring become made plain police court because exceptions exist our laws today this woman was not deemed inadmissible america because her simple assault charge carried less than 6-month penalty under new bill which would establish inadmissibility without any waivers exceptions all for victims would clearly have deemed inadmissible america exceptions would exist any longer for domestic violence victims who have committed minor crimes context resisting their violent abuse this means victim this case who legally united states student visa while attends college would barred permanently from obtaining green card any new immigration status simply because was victim attempted rape who fought back against her attacker with ability ever adjust her status under law would deported kicked out our country permanently some might say this price should rightly pay for biting hitting back her violent abuser but really want say would not want our daughters sisters mothers same situation should really compound horrors domestic violence assaults with harsh immigration penalty victims want give domestic abusers more power over their victims giving them more opportunities file charges true false against their victims keep them from reporting their abuse authorities seems live time speaker when very easy forgive sexual abusers assailants rapists sexual harassers who have lot power wealth society but very hard forgive their victims for fighting back look what going across hallway secretary defense nominee pete hegseth has been credibly accused sexually assaulting woman conference 2017 entered into major private financial settlement over charges there are people planning vote for this legislation today who also support his nomination education secretary nominee linda mcmahon her husband were recently sued for failing act credible allegations sexual abuse within world wrestling entertainment organization finally course president-elect's initial pick for attorney general matt gaetz faces numerous allegations sex trafficking minor statutory rape there are civil adjudications sexual abuse going very top new administration law stands today have had for decades provides for waivers protect immigration status victims domestic violence who are charged with fighting back against their abuser while proposed bill would retain waivers for victims deportability context would not allow for waivers exceptions inadmissibility context don't know why this asymmetry discordance were written into this legislation whether was deliberate just accidental but upshot entire national movement working arrest reduce domestic violence america now opposing this bill claims support victims domestic violence note another serious problem with bill which makes backfire again against victims would significantly expand definition domestic violence include statutory violence against women act definition used for civil context grants funding this much broader definition was never designed used criminal law fact definition explicitly says covers conduct may may not constitute criminal behavior definition domestic violence under existing federal criminal law which currently also used immigration law focuses element speaker physical force but broader vawa-based definition appropriately fitted for grant funding purposes sweeps broad range behaviors including verbal psychological economic technological abuse once again inadmissibility context this transposition can have severe consequences imagine domestic violence victim covered daca who flees her abuser removes half money from their joint bank account enough get train bus ticket get away imagine abuser calls police claims stole money from him committed theft merely admitting fact took funds out their bank account victim could end being deemed inadmissible then removed from america remember new inadmissibility grounds created this bill not require conviction but mere admission underlying facts point clear our goal prevent violence against women illegal aliens bill's title says our current criminal immigration laws already have strict punishments place for anyone who commits such crimes including deportation inadmissibility for foreign nationals this bill would only make immigration laws much harsher victims domestic violence sexual battery rape which opposite what should doing america when lives its ideals tom paine said will become asylum humanity not insane asylum mind but place refuge for people seeking freedom from religious political economic oppression also might add kind private gender violence creates oppression tyranny home two centuries later ronald reagan echoed sentiment reminding america was shining city upon hill refuge for all pilgrims from all places who are hurtling through darkness toward home last year celebrated 30th anniversary violence against women act must continue our work oppose tyranny domestic violence over women our country but this legislation would set back our efforts protect survivors stop abuse page h194 speaker ask majority reconsider this legislation for colleagues join opposing speaker reserve balance time lee florida speaker yield minutes gentleman from north carolina harris harris north carolina speaker rise today support h.r preventing violence against women illegal aliens act speaker common sense dictates illegal alien our country commits sex offense domestic violence should deported immediately common sense dictates alien border has committed these kinds egregious crimes their past should not allowed take one step onto american soil anything short this standard complete utter failure protect american women girls this bill before today ensures just republicans have been called clean biden's border crisis means not only deporting illegal alien sex offenders abusers but must stop them from coming into our country first place common sense legislation before today codifies this standard preventing violence against women illegal aliens act shouldn't controversial sadly saw last week with laken riley act many our colleagues other side aisle will use any excuse oppose commonsense border security stand behalf constituents north carolina's eighth congressional district urge colleagues support this crucial initiative our fight keep our citizens safe raskin speaker yield minutes gentlewoman from washington jayapal jayapal speaker here are once again with republican colleagues bringing bill floor does absolutely nothing address needs american people republican colleagues made lots campaign promises lower costs for everyday americans but not single bill far has done anything like instead this week appears week where say are protecting women yet their actions tell different story today are discussing bill takes violence against women act bill meant protect victims domestic violence weaponizes against domestic violence victims time 0945 speaker exactly why 200 local national advocacy organizations for survivors domestic violence from across country with deep expertise this area have come out strongly oppose this bill talking about national task force end sexual domestic violence national alliance end sexual violence national network end domestic violence asian pacific institute gender-based violence groups serve domestic violence survivors more than states across country let very clear once again under our current laws those who are convicted admit domestic violence crimes listed this bill are already deportable inadmissible country there actually gap law needs fixed instead perverse move this bill would make easier label survivors domestic violence perpetrators make them removable from country eliminate existing legal safeguards protect survivors once again this bill widens highway donald trump's mass deportation plans want talk through example police show domestic violence call victim was attacked her abuser fought back self-defense maybe abuser has some scratches his face common practice for police arrest both parties situation when responding domestic violence incident police write report describing how victim hit her abuser self defense under this bill admission constituting elements domestic violence this woman now inadmissible subject deportation even never charged even judge later rules did not commit any crime so-called admission police report responded self-defense hit her abuser enough make her inadmissible under this bill again why more than 200 advocacy organizations for domestic violence survivors deeply ensconced material what happens every day across country far too often are all deeply opposed this legislation know this expansive bill eliminates existing safeguards for domestic violence survivors will harm those exact survivors create chilling effect for reporting future crimes empowering abusers after immigrant women children right now are only talking about immigrant survivors this bill start dangerous road watering down protections for all victims domestic violence across country who next violence against women act landmark piece legislation testament time when democrats republicans could actually come together legislate issues fundamental importance this nation despite our differences initial iteration vawa passed house voice vote can imagine passed voice vote reshaped how country talk about gender-based violence how treat survivors violence against women act recognized cannot serious about eliminating violence against women are not equally serious about eradicating violence against everyone regardless immigration status there are many reasons why individuals domestic violence situations are unjustly forced into criminal legal system have seen data too often survivors are arrested alongside their abuser are charged even convicted crimes involving violence which later prove self-defense unjustly charged this bill makes more likely harm very people want protect speaker pro tempore time gentlewoman has expired raskin speaker yield additional minute gentlewoman from washington jayapal speaker here cruel irony same week republicans are putting forth nomination secretary defense who won't even say sexual assault disqualifying republicans want fool into thinking care about domestic violence sexual assault survivors suppose shouldn't surprised despite vawa's bipartisan history now have fight tooth nail reauthorize was republicans who let violence against women act languish expire for years leader republican party once again man who was found liable for sexual misconduct bragged about grabbing forcibly kissing women without their consent last year celebrated 30th anniversary vawa's enactment today have watch our colleagues across aisle make another cheap attempt divide play gotcha politics should work together eradicate domestic violence bill wise act would strengthen protections for survivors wish could here not this harmful misleading bill urge colleagues oppose speaker include record letter from over 200 local national domestic violence organizations who oppose this bill national task force end sexual domestic violence january honorable members house undersigned groups serve advocate behalf victims domestic violence sexual assault dating violence stalking human trafficking write voice our opposition oppose this legislation would expand circumstances under which domestic violence child abuse neglect stalking sex offenses would constitute grounds inadmissibility well expand definition domestic violence considered for inadmissibility deportability grounds these measures would negatively impact immigrant survivors domestic sexual violence fail alleviate primary barriers safety stability experienced survivors seeking relief under immigration nationality act are especially troubled this legislation fails include waivers take into page h195 account needs victim their family will limit discretion judges can exercise where equities warrant including situations where survivors who are inadvertently caught criminal legal system will harmed unfortunately immigrant victims are particularly vulnerable being arrested prosecuted for domestic violence acted self-defense are accused abuser being primary aggressor well-known tactic abusers maintain power control over their victims report threaten report their partner authorities including local law enforcement child protective services ice others--falsely claiming their partner victim their violence one who violent neglectful etc these false reports threats them are too often highly effective keeping victims trapped violent relationships moreover know parents color are disproportionately accused child abuse offenses including abandonment neglect domestic violence survivors are not infrequently charged with child neglect for having failed protect their children from witnessing exposure adult's violence committed against non-abusive parent resulting doubly penalizing survivor children for violence committed someone else this legislation creates grounds inadmissibility for these offenses without requiring conviction circumstances where individual admits committed acts would constitute crime language cultural barriers fear abuser authorities confusion intimidation lack awareness rights lack access advocates other resources all may prevent immigrant victim from being able communicate what really happened once custody and/or facing trial desperate released reunited with their children these same factors--combined with poor legal counsel particularly about immigration consequences criminal pleas convictions--could lead ineligibility for status deportation wrongly accused victims who may have pled been unfairly convicted domestic violence charges legislation's expansion definition domestic violence which was expressly included violence against women act allow for provision greater array victim services include circumstances may not involve violence physical force threats such also likely sweep more survivors into scope ground inadmissibility deportability this will result more victims being deported and/or bar them from obtaining lawful status doing invites additional scrutiny survivors during course their efforts obtain immigration protections safety from violence furthermore expanding grounds inadmissibility ineligibility for status with waivers would increase risk victims will decline seek assistance from law enforcement services fear will result family member being barred from legal status when creating penalties balance key deterrence critically important but will ineffective consequences are severe survivors will not come forward although are grateful for efforts lawmakers seek address impact domestic violence sexual assault dating violence stalking believe best way expanding accessibility survivor-based immigration relief related benefits noncitizen survivors eliminating cap visas available petitioners for nonimmigrant visas number cases eligible for final adjudications vawa cancellation removal rather than rushing enact additional immigration pe4alties could cause harm survivors urge congressional representatives consult with service providers survivors themselves

time democrats claim this bill unnecessary because aliens who commit sex offenses domestic violence offenses are already inadmissible removable ignores reality take for example fact under current immigration law there explicit ground inadmissibility for illegal aliens who commit domestic violence offenses despite ground removability for aliens who commit such offenses consider despite certain sex offenses making aliens removable from country there currently not ground inadmissibility removability for certain sex offenses although some aliens who commit these offenses may found inadmissible removable for having committed crime involving moral turpitude far from certain under current law loopholes abound for example ninth circuit held conviction for menacing constituting domestic violence was not crime involving moral turpitude even though alien threatened his wife with knife third circuit held alien was not removable despite conviction for involuntary devient sexual intercourse with 15-year old similarly courts have found certain convictions for contributing delinquency minor assault victim under years old annoying molesting child are not crimes involving moral turpitude why this bill imperative ensure criminal aliens who endanger families communities can removed from united states biden-harris administration's war women must come end this bill one step toward making guests

supporters deliberately allowed into our country over these last years laken's case murderer was paroled into this country through shocking abuse power was repeatedly arrested for theft other crimes sanctuary jurisdictions each time released back onto our streets just months before murdered laken was arrested for theft but ice couldn't take him into custody because biden harris administration's policies shielded such monsters from arrest deportation this measure first introduced representative mike collins would require ice detention for illegal aliens who are charged with arrested for convicted any burglary theft larceny shoplifting offense democrats have argued mere accusation committing crime should not grounds for detention shoplifting big deal ignore fact every illegal alien currently required detained current law throughout pendency their asylum claims democrats have thumbed their noses this law for past years their excuse were prioritizing detaining more dangerous offenders this bill does exactly yet still oppose time 1415 during his first term president trump proved president his own authority can secure our borders president biden proved president who determined make mockery our immigration laws can willfully open our borders most violent criminals terrorists gangs cartels this planet then use democrats sanctuary laws protect them this national nightmare ended noon monday but what future presidents this bill ensures what happened laken riley cannot happen again should another joe biden disgrace presidency our senate colleagues have added laken riley act parts sarah's law introduced representative randy feenstra senator joni ernst mandate detention for illegal aliens who commit any offense involves death serious bodily injury sarah's law was named after sarah root january 2016 sarah drove home after celebrating her college graduation illegal alien who was street racing while drunk slammed into her suv snapping sarah's spine fracturing her skull sarah died days later february within hours her death judge set illegal's bond 50,000 because detainer was filed despite desperate request local police administration defended this dereliction duty because illegal alien had not been convicted criminal charge therefore was not enforcement priority closes this loophole requiring detention for illegal aliens like sarah root's killer who are arrested for charged with admitted convicted any crime resulted someone's death serious bodily injury addition this bill includes elements representative jeff van drew's detain deport illegal aliens who assault cops act which passed house last year applies same mandate for those who assault law enforcement officials this bill would also allow states bring civil action against derelict federal officers who refuse enforce immigration law this was first introduced representatives dan bishop chip roy sue for immigration enforcement act bill also passed house twice part laken riley act bill was also killed senate democrats last year whether sober reflection perhaps sobering results november election handful democrats both house senate have now come over support this law welcome them wish them well convincing majority their party need change course not for good our country then least for good themselves will take their support any way can get have every confidence president trump will end this scourge upon our nation during next years this law others will follow will ensure future president will able unleash upon our country what joe biden his democratic supporters did page h279 speaker urge colleagues support this bill reserve balance time raskin speaker yield myself such time may consume speaker rise opposition have all these fine speeches all these fancy parties with billionaires congressmen tuxedos all these executive orders for big oil tech broligarchs all these complete unconditional pardons for proud boys oath keepers violent extremists who chanted hang mike pence smashed swarmed wounded our police officers this building with steel poles baseball bats american flags confederate battle flags bear mace--all this sound fury day one week one but nothing bring down grocery prices nothing bring down cost rent promised nothing improve our healthcare system build our success last congress reducing prescription drug prices nothing get health insurance coverage for millions people who don't have nothing bring down cost housing build new housing nothing combat nightmare climate change other than full-scale retreat withdrawing from paris climate accord nothing address real problems faced american people today want change subject from indelible shocking public safety disaster president releasing hundreds convicted felons specifically violent cop-beating felons caught tape act whom had incited january 2021 back into population with plan for protecting american people public safety what want talk about today their wisdom public safety immigration great let's this bill does nothing address major problems face immigration system secure american border nor does anything address major problems face public safety such central overriding problem out-of-control gun violence which takes tens thousands american citizens lives every year leading cause death among american citizen children age speaker may surprise lot americans but actually know how solve these problems how make substantial progress both immigration public safety roadblock majority completely lacks political will why well republicans are divided between two extreme positions big business tech oligarchs who bankroll their party who love cheap foreign labor under current regime inflamed nativist maga element who want shut down all immigration including legal immigration believe rightwing conspiracy theories like racist great replacement theory congress could pass bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform this week senate republicans democrats reached powerful painstaking compromise with president biden last year fortify our border with more border agents more enforcement more detection technology more asylum judges more funding but president trump told house republicans tank this popular bipartisan agreement sink didn't want bipartisan border solution improve things real world wanted permanent border crisis run against not doing anything means trump doesn't offend his big business supporters who want cheap foreign labor under current regime but allows him pander indefinitely his maga base with nativist rhetoric tiny little messaging bills move few words around but don't fundamentally change anything should add tough border measures already negotiated last congress meaningful pathway citizenship proposed for dreamers tps holders other law-abiding productive immigrants move from demagoguery deliberation can flesh this out can make immigration work for america nation built immigrants have huge job shortages agriculture manufacturing retail seafood nursing hospitals many other areas should not plunging america into chaos deport millions people when already need millions new people work here gop plan deporting million people were really happen would plunge into another trump economic crisis like last one under covid-19 but maybe even cause depression this time vast majority americans know what common sense dictates must make lot harder for people get into our country illegally but must make lot easier for people get into our country lawfully today only percent people seeking admission lawfully are admitted donald trump his first administration crippled legal immigration into country banned many legal immigrants unable prove have high incomes banned immigrants from specific countries banned most visa applicants most skilled temporary workers deeming them economic threat must reform our system consistent with our values nation similarly when comes public safety could arrive commonsense bipartisan agenda right now make our communities lot safer were serious about let's take central problem gun violence for example which now takes more than 48,000 american lives year leading cause death for children young people america age gun violence costs costs america astonishing 557 billion year speaker more than half trillion dollars year because gun violence mass shootings with ar-15 other assault weapons have become terrifying feature gun violence america although account for just over percent tens thousands lives generally gun violence with old-fashioned handgun homicides suicides accidents continuing cause vast majority deaths here are some policies vast majority americans support could pass this week would allow speaker congress could close loopholes brady legislation like internet loophole private gun show loophole could pass universal violent criminal background checks all gun purchases something supported upward percent american people vast majorities people both political parties independents conservatives liberals gun owners non-gun owners almost everybody supports could pass military-style assault weapons ban which more than percent americans support could crack down proliferating danger ghost guns could expand red flag laws nationwide alas our colleagues refuse any because their well advertised compassion for american victims violent crimes committed undocumented aliens which base their entire argument which all share apparently does not extend far larger class american victims violent gun crimes committed other american citizens even though have not just 48,000 americans killed every year but 115,000 american citizens wounded maimed trying survive this gun violence debacle handed nra their followers congress argue second amendment prevents all these commonsense gun safety measures even though supreme court has repeatedly upheld them including assault weapon ban criminal background checks gun buyers when white supremacist gunman bearing ar-15 assassinates dozens american citizen schoolchildren connecticut florida dozens citizen noncitizen walmart shoppers paso texas supermarket shoppers buffalo worshippers mother emanuel church charleston south carolina worshippers tree life synagogue pittsburgh pennsylvania our colleagues extend only thoughts prayers say nothing can done alas there just evil world second amendment keeps them from acting just have accept this inescapable human price sacrifice paid for second amendment even though not what supreme court says page h280 least today shows think something can done stop violent crime america will take their newfound sense moral outrage compassion apply not just one case but tens thousands victims gun violence america america waiting for answer what majority proposing today bill subject mandatory detention not just undocumented people who have been convicted theft shoplifting other criminal offenses which has been law supported unanimously both parties since 1996 but people who have been simply charged with such offenses arrested for such offenses even charges are dropped even are never filed first place odd way fix border because has nothing with border extremely attenuated constitutionally dubious way protect public safety vast majority serious crimes committed america are committed american citizens not aliens vast majority aliens don't commit crimes all time 1430 however this bill doesn't even focus culpable class undocumented immigrants who commit crimes law already does focuses those who are arrested even are never charged those who are charged with crimes even are never convicted even their charges are dropped young person daca who with group friends when one them arrested for shoplifting then all kids get charged will subject mandatory detention deportation even child was not shoplifting charges are dropped bill likely pass doubt because profound sympathy all share for parents family laken riley who have suffered unthinkable totally shocking profoundly unnecessary trauma this should not partisan issue should not demagogued for partisan purposes nevertheless when get serious about comprehensive threats public safety our immigration system will have address mass crises staring face like gun violence epidemic which takes lives tens thousands american citizens every year hands overwhelmingly u.s citizen gunmen speaker reserve balance time mcclintock speaker so-called bipartisan legislation gentleman refers would have made impossible for president trump have taken actions has just taken secure our

ban assault weapons for decade was perfectly constitutional have brady act have violent criminal background check but even though expanding make universal would save hundreds thousands american citizen lives every year won't touch don't invoke emotion selectively say everybody has got along with what are saying without even analyzing policy implications constitutional implications are not willing put anything table reduce sickening death toll for gun violence america there nothing world approaches what have got here times higher than countries dozens times higher than japan canada u.k name yet pretend there problem seize opportunistic bill like this try drive wedge within our congress within our people hope better when get second week this new administration than freeing violent

why oppose this nomination let begin saying often vote for nominees who have different policy views than however concerns with ratcliffe are much deeper than opposed his confirmation director national intelligence because believe his partisanship willingness essentially went proposition doing what would please donald trump unfortunately his actions head national intelligence only confirmed concerns today want focus john ratcliffe's commitment law his truthfulness with congress will give couple examples illustrate concerns 2019 congress passed law requiring director national intelligence submit unclassified report who was responsible for brutal murder washington post reporter u.s resident jamal khashoggi after john ratcliffe was nominated head national intelligence asked him his confirmation hearing whether intended follow law responded needed take look underlying intelligence see what could released not same saying would law required after director ratcliffe was confirmed dni decided nothing more could declassified about murder jamal khashoggi effect decision was cover fact saudi prince mohammed bin salman approved operation capture kill khashoggi public only has facts today because after election then-head national intelligence avril haines abided law released report but while john ratcliffe was director national intelligence saudi leadership was protected from public accountability while was director national intelligence director ratcliffe wrote multiple members congress saying had completed his review intelligence determined nothing more could released despite fact congress passed law director ratcliffe insisted there was only marginal public interest declassification said this three letters acting chairman rubio vice chairman warner chair house intelligence committee this raises questions about john ratcliffe's commitment law basically have concerns about his truthfulness with congress part this nomination process submitted written question asking him why didn't obey law responded review had been necessary determine what could declassified quote here this review was not completed until after left office madam president statement ratcliffe just wasn't true ratcliffe wrote three letters congress saying review had been completed fact was even included odni's representations court foia case here why opposing ratcliffe nomination john ratcliffe willing make representations congress are contradicted what public record imagine how easy would for him misrepresent classified matters behind veil secrecy there are other aspects john ratcliffe's record dni are troubling said during his confirmation hearing would tell truth power record suggests otherwise for example end september released intelligence about hillary clinton's 2016 campaign was even though intelligence community didn't know was accurate extent which was fabricated exaggerated russian intelligence needless say this was major break from standard practice hard escape conclusion was done for partisan political purposes particularly given timing asked ratcliffe whether had ever taken any actions were actually conflict with positions president his response was simply offer nothing madam president concerns john ratcliffe was too partisan confirmed head intelligence agency have been validated these specific examples have cited today said also now has record ignoring law passed u.s congress then misrepresenting basic facts about decision when senate does vote ratcliffe nomination want record show strongly oppose nomination yield floor presiding officer

shape america extreme wealth power influence literally threatens our entire democracy our basic rights freedoms fair shot for everyone get ahead don't know who president biden was talking about but know one particular circumstance about which going speak fits his warning again don't know circumstance about describe what president biden meant but shoe fits wear cinderella let cut chase george soros oligarch one wealthiest people world friend president biden's--nothing wrong with fact president biden just gave him think highest civilian honor president can give civilian--the presidential medal freedom george soros buying wwl radio new orleans let say again may not mean much president but means lot people louisiana george soros buying wwl radio new orleans wwl radio practically institution state has been around since 1922--1922--over 100 years clear channel--what communications experts call clear channel class station its transmitter output about 50,000 watts lot folks maximum for commercial stations united states lead station new orleans saints radio network important station george soros buying what does mean how did this happen wwl owned national company called audacy audacy has about 220 radio stations nationwide one which course wwl--the second largest radio network america reaches think different markets throughout our country 165 million americans huge audacy borrowed too much money took too much debt took about 1.9 billion worth debt couldn't service debt with their revenues what did did what many other corporations when can't service their debt went into what called chapter bankruptcy--not chapter chapter when liquidate company chapter bankruptcy when company goes into bankruptcy front bankruptcy judge says judge want get all our creditors debtors together restructure our cash flow our debt can come out this bankruptcy surviving entity went into chapter with bankruptcy plan george soros immediately pounced 1.9 billion debt bought about 415 million cash barrelhead paid cents dollar one tenets reorganization was all current shareholders would wiped out new creditors would assume equity positions company know sounds complicated can but really what means bondholders--one which soros after bought bought 450 million worth debt became shareholder soros now largest single shareholder audacy radio stations including wwl new orleans institution america can't just this why because those airwaves which wwl other radio stations broadcast--they don't belong radio stations belong these airwaves--the spectrum will--are owned american people years ago created federal communications commission fcc set charge airwaves belong american people make sure those airwaves were being used prudently radio stations for example radio station bought bunch foreign nationals foreign entities fcc has approve for example anytime broadcast license case with audacy transferred fcc has approve soros's purchase wwl radio 219 other page s269 radio stations had before fcc did went--the approval for soros went through fcc like green grass through goose was party-line vote was last september all three democrats--there are five people fcc--all three democrats said let short-circuited normal process now not fcc expert not communications law expert but this has been widely reported have read about many reports normally deal this size when 220 radio stations are being transferred--their licenses--using airwaves belong american people there substantial percentage foreign owners would take about year get through fcc fcc would complete investigation not this time--no this time was special what happened was what some members media have called soros shortcut just got together rammed through did mention was like green grass through goose--3 now two republicans commission--they are screaming whole time whoa nellie whoa whoa why aren't taking this seriously why aren't investigating this why aren't doing our due diligence were outvoted know even democracy when have votes--you can make porcupine like hot peppers have votes doesn't make right number people petitioned fcc said please don't this one groups petitioned fcc was group called media research center fcc--three democrats two republicans--dismissed them but this what media research center said--their words not mine there question george soros his affiliated businesses are looking control these radio stations advance their particular brand activism mrc urged fcc not create special soros shortcut would circumvent their rules allow deal move forward did anyway here what troy miller nrb president ceo said said--his words not mine fact fcc apparently willing bypass usual protocols means normal procedures get this transaction done just weeks before presidential election right after president united states gave soros presidential medal freedom seriously undermines commission's credibility raises warranted questions whether administrative processes are being manipulated manipulated exert political interference preference here what one republican members fcc dissent said--commissioner brendan carr who soon chairman fcc now there new sheriff town here what carr said commission's decision today approving soros's plan unprecedented never before has commission voted approve transfer broadcast license--let alone transfer broadcast licenses for over 200 radio stations across more than markets--without following requirements procedures codified federal law pass sick bucket this isn't right but did now this america are entitled believe what want legal are entitled what want soros certainly entitled his opinion don't agree with him but certainly entitled america not much into this cancel culture hopefully have seen end but when are acquiring radio licenses which can influence public opinion are doing part--not exclusively but part--with foreign money well why have fcc but want make this clear believe free speech free expression are not free can't say what think are not free can't express yourself soros has right but here where stands want people louisiana know who buying wwl radio new orleans soros billionaire god bless him made his money himself has poured much his wealth into what opinion are radical causes now working with his son who understand very smart young man his name alex soros george soros alex soros hold some--how should put this?--nonmainstream american beliefs for example george soros has called united states main obstacle stable just world soros believes our country main obstacle stable just world not china not iran not north korea--the united states america pass sick bucket soros has also said china has--his words not mine--that china has better functioning government than united states america soros does not believe united states should have secure borders once called national borders obstacle his plan for widespread immigrant resettlement soros his family probably know have spent millions millions dollars elect prosecutors throughout america who believe violent criminals are real victims these prosecutors believe for most part cop has shoot criminal always cop's fault but criminal shoots cop always gun's fault these prosecutors whom soros has backed with millions dollars all believe are concerned about crime are automatically racist soros his son alex--alex particular--have called for softer sentences violent criminals this what has said--his words not mine alex soros said but are serious about ending mass incarceration must also rethink our response crimes are more serious including violent ones even those who have been victims violence increasingly not believe long-term prison sentences short soros--both george alex believe america would better off had open borders believe america would better off opinion--this how read their writings--if ended jails ran our government like communist party china don't agree with but soros--both them are

about darla one her twins had serious medical complications not terminating pregnancy would have put her other twin's health risk how ignore something like will never understand but instead republicans are talking about things simply not happen however have different story share today see last time shared those stories women who were able make choice was right for their family but

will advance their so-called born-alive bill bill have all seen before which senate squarely rejected past bill deeply pernicious because attacks women's healthcare through false narratives outright fearmongering seeks make something illegal already illegal essence republican bill would substitute judgment qualified medical professionals wishes millions women their families with ultraright ideology long hand injustice reaching down hurting women from afar much legislation passed frankly men who have really understanding what women through when are through difficult situations like one colleague from washington state has outlined this would harm ability medical professionals provide healthcare based evidence science would expose medical professionals risk punishment prosecution

erode access high-quality safe reproductive care democrats will continue fight for america's women america's doctors america's families who sometimes have make heartbreaking difficult decisions when

his story moment but proves fact have existing laws make this current bill unnecessary tomorrow marks 52nd year since our nation's highest court issued rule recognizing woman's constitutionally protected right choose roe wade enshrined into law something should have been given america america women have right make decisions about their own bodies result roe america's women took giant leap forward gender equity decision roe afforded women right choose whether when how start family but after nearly years progress june 2022 supreme court overruled roe with dobbs jackson women's health organization dragging women's rights half century backward following decision saw republican-led states open floodgates abortion restrictions--laws some cases have had deadly consequences for women who could not access critical healthcare needed instead addressing healthcare crisis dobbs has unleashed republicans are now instead looking make even harder for women access comprehensive compassionate healthcare tomorrow will attempt bring floor so-called born alive abortion survivors protection act want bring vote--this bill senator schumer said already covered law bill say creates new standards care for physicians providing reproductive healthcare are not based medicine fact science goal bill will consider introduced republicans target intimidate reproductive healthcare providers make harder for women access comprehensive compassionate healthcare this bill offers poorly drafted dangerous solution problem simply does not exist authors this bill will tell this legislation simply ensures all children born alive result so-called attempted abortion are provided same medical care any other newborn same gestational age say all does but already have law books ensures any child born america regardless circumstances surrounding birth afforded equal protection under law 2002 house senate passed bipartisan basis born-alive infants protection act know who signed into law then-president george bush put simply already illegal kill child born alive america rare cases where doctor does harm baby violation state federal laws are held legally accountable year was 2013 kermit gosnell pennsylvania doctor was convicted three counts first-degree murder for murdering babies after botched abortions gosnell was sentenced life prison without possibility parole under existing law currently serving sentence page s272 pennsylvania's state correctional institution huntingdon know what else authors this legislation didn't tell won't tell abortions late pregnancy are incredibly rare when occur most often because heartbreaking late-breaking fatal fetal diagnosis because woman's doctor has told her may not survive pregnancy because woman lives state prevented her from getting abortion earlier republicans would rather have believe vast numbers women are intentionally waiting until final days their pregnancy have abortions this cruel political contrivance these are women who often already have had their baby showers picked out names persevered through morning sickness back pain swollen ankles countless doctors appointments tests these are women who wanted their babies what response from actual doctors this legislation ask professionals respond republican bill coming floor so-called born-alive bill american college obstetricians gynecologists said this when house passed bill last year offensively named born-alive legislation another cruel misguided attempt interfere with evidence-based medical decision making between patients their physicians laws ban criminalize evidence-based care rely medically unsupported theories misinformation are dangerous families their clinicians this bill negatively affects all obstetric gynecologic care what just read quote from american college obstetricians gynecologists given this reality what would happen this bill were signed into law new president take case meredith shiner constituent mine illinois who was thrilled learn few years ago her husband were going have little baby boy however weeks days meredith woke with terrible abdominal pain rushed hospital thinking had bladder infection didn't realize seriousness what was happening until doctor told her was labor prognosis was grim having baby weeks days meant although baby would born alive chances survival were almost nonexistent knowing medical interventions would futile meredith her husband made difficult decision take minutes had with their son hold him touch him look him until gently passed away doctors provided palliative care this bill written such overly broad way vague way had been law those same doctors provided compassionate care meredith her husband their son could subject years prison these heartbreaking situations not time for politicians dictate course medical treatment this bill would those wrenching decisions those personal tragic moments must left medical professionals individuals their care only compassionate outcome this week lifelong advocate for women's rights cecile richards spent her life fighting keep politics out healthcare defending every woman's right decide when how start their family cecile glioblastoma--the same brain cancer took john mccain beau biden teddy kennedy senate republicans truly cared about saving lives would working with expand access healthcare increase funding for medical research results new cures implement policies address our nation's abysmal record infant maternal mortality yield floor presiding officer senator from minnesota smith president rise today with colleagues senator murray senator schumer senator durbin close colleague from minnesota senator klobuchar others stand for women for doctors home state minnesota around country just want appreciate senator durbin for raising cecile richards who was dear friend mine someone who worked with closely when worked planned parenthood was thinking about something cecile often pointed would quote great american poet edna vincent millay this poet would say not one damn thing after another same damn thing over over again here have being shown senate floor once again republicans are here introducing this bill--not talk about what can lower prices for americans not talk about how can lower cost housing how help people's lives become more affordable instead one very first bills are putting forward for vote service national abortion ban can tell people minnesota not want people america have made abundantly clear not want guess nicest thing could say about this out touch with where americans are but let's talk about little bit more because think important fight some myths disinformation this legislation promotes what this bill would would put congress politicians middle personal medical decisions patients doctors should able make together without political interference would override physicians professional judgments about what best for their patients would put physicians position facing criminal penalties their judgment about what best for their patients goes against what described this bill colleagues let's clear core debate here whether not trust women make very best decisions for themselves their families difficult medical challenging often tragic medical situations should women their physicians making decisions about their lives their health--often their very lives--or this about politics think americans say this not about politics politics should stay out know everybody this floor has talked their own constituents who have experienced what really happens for women who are needing abortion care later their pregnancy these stories are inevitably heartbreaking tragic each are individual unique every situation different but always are about women families are thrilled pregnant some cases colleagues have said have already picked out name have decorated nursery have planned baby shower but becomes clear pregnancy progresses devastating news this child not going survive some cases mother's life also risk her health her ability have children future are risk said every situation going unique because everyone going have different diagnosis different personal histories different family circumstances means everybody going need have their own individual care but what every single one these women have common each one them deserves dignity autonomy freedom able make those decisions make their own medical decisions without bunch politicians getting way but let's really clear here women are not waking last weeks their pregnancy just change their mind about pregnancy mean how disrespectful women attitude because these are terrible situations where something has gone catastrophically wrong are not just changing their minds are doing everything can take care themselves their families know know this country don't tell oncologists how treat their patients don't tell emergency room doctors what need any specific circumstances save lives shouldn't telling women's doctors how take care their patients but colleagues what this bill does would give politicians this room seat doctor's offices ers with women all over this page s273 country has intimidating impact providers who are already desperately trying keep their head down their jobs while operating under chaos has erupted after supreme court overturned roe colleagues this should about treating women with respect should all agreement decisions about women's healthcare aren't different from decisions about men's healthcare anyone's healthcare why would treating women differently colleagues let's get out business dictating medical care for women let's trust women their doctors urge colleagues oppose this legislation yield floor presiding officer senator from minnesota klobuchar president rise today with colleagues want thank senator murray for her leadership but also senator smith who has long led this issue has stood time time again for freedoms reproductive freedom yesterday noted cecile richards who was true force nature who spent her career fighting for reproductive freedom her just days before what would 52nd anniversary roe wade but all know our country now well into its third year without protections roe years since supreme court overturned half century precedent stripped away woman's right make her own healthcare decisions--going against percent americans who believe this decision should made woman her family her doctor not politicians who believe colleagues just noted politicians should not waiting room making decisions for families--women are now mercy patchwork state laws are creating chaos when comes accessing reproductive care solution not bill before this week solution not take rare cases most tragic nature colleagues have described former prosecutor know what murder murder murder including murder baby are here talking about tragic cases where doctors have make decision moment with family about how are going handle very very tragic situations with baby today nearly states have enacted some form abortion restriction result third women reproductive age now live under extreme dangerous bans states across country women are being turned away from emergency rooms forced travel hundreds miles for healthcare adding situation this idea are going start intervening these rare tragic cases would horrible result for many women thinking about pregnant teenager texas who died after being denied care three hospital visits thinking about young woman from florida who was forced miscarry bathroom due her state's restrictions time finally got hospital had almost half blood her body will never forget heartbreaking story 10-year-old ohio who had indiana order get legal abortion after was raped people said story was hoax wasn't hoax was true doctors are being threatened with prosecution for doing their jobs issue will only get worse pass legislation republicans have brought floor already know there have been repeated attempts restrict mifepristone just last week judge allowed idaho kansas missouri proceed with their lawsuit challenging fda approval drug which safely used countries this our reality right now but doesn't have our future call our colleagues join codifying roe wade into law simply because someone may have different views--i know many people own family who may pro-life but don't believe their views for what would their personal life would apply other people--and certainly not people--women--who very end pregnancy something have been looking forward

colleagues vote with reject this bill yield floor presiding officer budd senator from connecticut blumenthal president proud join colleagues floor today opposition born-alive abortion survivor protection act are wondering whether title legislation makes sense answer does not this legislation simply blatant attempt interfere with evidence-based patient care medical practices while enshrining lies about abortion care republican colleagues spent last years calling democrats alarmists but here are aggressively pursuing legislation would persecute providers for doing their jobs making tragic situation for families even worse medical professionals are have always been required law provide infants high-quality care from moment are born there absolutely evidence this law being broken suggest otherwise deeply offensive dangerous for any family all know families are not our own--learning their child will stillborn not survive beyond birth profound deeply grief-stricken this legislation would deepen would remove any control woman may have over her pregnancy force family endure unnecessary unethical medical overreach hands politicians--that right hands politicians not medical personnel bill would force physicians provide invasive hopeless measures which are both medically ethically inappropriate these situations why american college obstetricians gynecologists strongly oppose this legislative effort let's listen doctors scientists professionals rather than trying message bill anti-scientific anti-medical science stand have seen now how overturning roe has emboldened republicans across united states this very chamber make policy based their own personal beliefs instead evidence-based practices this legislation just another opportunity for republicans stand their soapbox lie american people also creates fear apprehension part people across country these policies actively harm families pretending otherwise slap face those who voted for all particular let close invoking spirit cecile richards after losing her just yesterday was giant modeled guts grit public service showing courage fortitude beyond words champion women's reproductive freedom will always

what statement about republican priorities this one first pieces legislation brought senate floor just few hours after donald trump was sworn into office republicans talk big game about being pro-life being party family values their actions show reality couldn't any further from truth for example republicans recently blocked bipartisan expansion child tax credit would have really helped lift kids out poverty now are gearing cut food stamps kids hungry put medicaid health insurance for millions children chopping block republicans really care about helping women children would using their new-found majority vote legislation cuts housing childcare costs grocery bills keep moms safe let close this way president colleagues this deeply flawed republican born-alive bill real republican

right make our own decisions about our own reproductive health this legislation has one purpose make safe abortion services even more inaccessible intimidating doctors with threat criminal liability this fearmongering its finest choosing focus this bill during president trump's first week office some republicans--and say some because don't all support this bill--are choosing politicize family's problem instead focusing making life easier more affordable better for all americans which president trump promised when was campaigning when said wasn't interested federal law would outlaw abortions abortions performed later pregnancy are rare are done result fatal diagnoses for fetus mother both these are tragic heartbreaking situations one--i going repeat that--that one wants inserting new uncertainty risk criminal liability into process this legislation only further increases risk woman will not able get medical care needs this bill ignores these important realities hopes scoring political points with anti-choice factions timing done deliberately because many those groups are going here washington friday should see this bill for what political stunt again again every turn some republicans trump administration have pushed forward dangerous policies intended threaten access abortion care think just shameful should ashamed themselves this bill just another battle long line

will make harder for families make best healthcare decisions for themselves moments great heartbreak face final moments desired pregnancy final moments terminally ill newborn's life also remarkable this among first pieces legislation republicans have brought floor since inauguration new president this course legislation search problem but not search motive some colleagues have decided rather than address most pressing issues facing american people will instead push legislation curtail freedom women--just latest their long line effort since roe was overturned take away more more freedom from half population willing eager work with colleagues tackle greatest challenges facing our country what our constituents expect deserve something this bill clearly fails this legislation will not bring down price groceries nor will reduce rents anything make easier for families make ends meet but will make life harder for expectant mothers facing painful choice won't make healthcare more affordable though provides doctors can put jail for providing care for their patients won't keep our children safe from crime fentanyl traffickers though will make our daughters less free this

think there more important office this country having power responsibility for 3.4 million americans most them uniform many them civilians all them potentially putting their lives harm's way president's choice lead department defense not only one most significant will make but also probably most unqualified nominee for this position immense authority responsibility recent history clear his history mismanagement--he drove two veterans organizations into ground financially--makes him patently incapable powerfully challenging management task will have secretary defense this sprawling enterprise has directed guided someone who has had some significant management responsibility past hesitate say how much because standard bar have always been extremely high under both republican democratic administrations including president trump's first term when appointed general mattis voted for general mattis was obviously republican nominee but had experience--not just combat but also pentagon now know president wants disrupter change agent pentagon may need some change disruption but not chaos not financial mismanagement such characterized pete hegseth's service head vets for freedom then concerned veterans for america what can said about his service those two organizations year after year spent more than raised had deficits year after year--not little bit hundreds thousands dollars end his service vets for freedom board did intervention had forensic study done which showed there were tens thousands dollars unpaid debt fact ousted him then went concerned veterans for america same pattern roughly same financial failings--deficits year after year significant their number total amount there again left under cloud with nondisclosure agreement don't have necessarily full story just management issue this nomination fundamentally flawed left those two separate organizations smoldering ruins after just few years their executive director have documents from whistleblowers detail toxic workplace environment those organizations was rife with alcohol abuse sexual harassment under his leadership former employees have detailed hegseth routinely used organization funds pursue personal pleasures usually involving alcohol women his underlings referred them party girls these veterans service organizations ran fiscal surpluses before hegseth's tenure upon his exit their budgets were really flames one case organization simply ceased exist vets for freedom was absorbed another organization testified proud work did while was vets for freedom concerned veterans for america but made career advocating for policies would effect contract even defund veterans administration harm servicemembers veterans their families for years lambasted veterans who pursued disability compensation advocated for for-profit colleges make their living preying servicemembers veterans these organizations policies advocated could potentially have done grave harm our veterans during his confirmation hearing hegseth also refused answer questions regarding use active-duty military within borders united states one president's own former secretaries defense stated unequivocally option use active-duty forces law enforcement's role should only used matter last resort only most urgent dire situations yet president apparently laying down plans use active-duty military conduct mass deportations quell civil unrest americans don't want military our men women active duty raiding restaurants farms looking for individuals who have overstayed their visas president unwilling invest ice should not department defense pentagon our active duty men women going into homes workplaces schools churches hospitals effect performing raids--the law enforcement duty--that really are specifically prohibited statute pete hegseth will behind these policies many them has already endorsed most them unfortunately were not delved into any depth his hearing because much was sexual improprieties alcohol abuse other personal issues would disqualifying let's make mistake there lot focus this latest affidavit there significant information--not anonymous smears significant information page s328 affidavit but there was already enough record fact acknowledged during hearing hegseth himself information would disqualifying major were for promotion corporal were for promotion sergeant facts about marital infidelity--open blatant matter public record--that would disqualifying him within military fact might even subject him discipline within military other reported instances drunkenness misconduct all public record acknowledged him--at least marital infidelity focus those personal aspects his background took time way had very limited amounts time because were not permitted second round questioning were not given access fbi background report were not given fact benefit full fbi background investigation--an adequate one--because there were gaps shown affidavit who was interviewed part why affidavit important because shows there were fact gaps fbi's investigation american people don't want national guard our military reserves their active duty their own neighbors streets des moines cleveland hartford montgomery--places where call home--checking their papers conducting surveillance operations could sweep vast amounts their private data our military going into our workplaces our homes collecting information founders this nation never envisioned our military police force neither did congress why have insurrection act other measures forbid kind intrusion fact was kind invasion their homes british military caused them adopt many our constitutional guarantees against use military for those kinds purposes hegseth declined state his opposition such deployments when asked during his hearing what said take him his word will heed president's direction commander chief reason was chosen for this job obviously not his experience manager not his bona fides leader major organizations his loyalty president donald trump more than loyalty fealty acquiescence obedience obsequiousness blind loyalty would lead him take order turn order american troops into people's homes there question beyond what could happen america our soil his confirmation would also present enormous problems for our allies partners middle east have been working with senior senator from south carolina for some years encourage normalization relations between state israel kingdom saudi arabia enterprise effort think has occupied many this chamber have visited region together one our objectives fact treaty agreement would bind closer together--israel saudi arabia america perhaps uae--as part normalization relations between saudi arabia regional nations israel suffice say recent cease-fire announcement between israel hamas historic shift regional politics believe hegseth's personal beliefs would diminish our support peace process derail entirely because comments has made about islam muslim nations those comments were explored some detail his testimony concern there have been numerous reports addition his own words appear convey hostility his part--if not outright antagonism--toward islam muslims former employee concerned veterans for america alleges shouted racist islamophobic chants during official tour ohio well-publicized well-known region where muslim nation islam are predominant his book american crusade expressed concern about muslim birthrights said present moment for christians like time crusades christians must arm themselves metaphorically intellectually physically our fight not with guns yet not with guns yet well are not time where need crusader old fashioned sense word who says christians must arm themselves metaphorically intellectually physically--physically--for fight may coming are trying engage those nations common purpose toward normalization peace stability expansion abraham accords people israel are hoping progress can made there can successful effort build abraham accords current cease-fire agreement result both trump administration biden administration coming together--the two teams brett mcgurk envoy witkoff--making sure peace was objective not antagonism hostility ambassador witkoff don't think would want secretary defense talking about crusade against muslim nations don't think more problematic concerning nominee has been put before this body urge republican colleagues review what senator murkowski senator collins said when announced were going oppose this nomination did earlier today senator murkowski said have met with him carefully reviewed his writings various reports other pertinent materials closely followed his hearing before senate armed services committee gathered substantial feedback from organizations veterans alaskans after thorough evaluation must conclude cannot good conscience support his nomination for secretary defense went onto talk about some allegations have been made against hegseth although has recently revised his statements women combat since being nominated remain concerned about message confirming hegseth sends women currently serving those aspiring join women have served our nation with distinction overcoming immense obstacles excel combat leadership roles deserve know their leader honors values their commitment our nation now reason for comment senator murkowski was statements made hegseth days before his hearing about lack value women serving military inability lack capacity women serve combat reversed himself what one colleagues called nomination conversion modified his previous remarks but couldn't tell what caused him have different opinion course hearing truly revealed continues have view women which problem for recruiting women are now percent our military force more than just recruiting women retaining women especially when scourge sexual assault continues problematic military fought for years number armed services committee have supported measures would provide for more effective prosecution through system investigation outside chain command adopted those reforms military leaders have joined seeking combat sexual assault harassment here have someone who has been accused very credibly plausibly not just this affidavit but others record replete with them there are accusations there are convictions here hegseth denies them but again simply what acknowledges having done would disqualify him from role command military background record can't help but discourage women from joining staying military senator murkowski goes onto say while allegations sexual assault excessive drinking nothing quiet concerns past behaviors hegseth has admitted including infidelity multiple occasions demonstrate lack judgment unbecoming someone who would lead our armed forces these behaviors starkly contrast values discipline expected servicemembers men women uniform are held accountable for such actions deserve leaders who uphold these same standards page s329 hegseth complained our hearing military was lowering its standards for men women who serve uniform only standards being lowered here are standards for secretary defense hegseth confirmed president trump effect dumbing down department defense threatens great damage powerfully important institution senator murkowski goes onto say above all believe character defining trait required secretary defense must prioritized without compromise leader department defense must demonstrate model standards behavior character expect all servicemembers hegseth's nomination role poses significant concerns cannot overlook given global security environment we're operating critical confirm secretary defense however regret unable support hegseth what powerfully damning statement not damning necessarily hegseth human being respect his service said hearing was grateful respectful his service our nation including leading troops combat advocating for veterans but these concerns about his personal background about his lack experience negate respect for his service secretary defense--as secretary defense are not choosing him colonel promoted are choosing him lead entire u.s military make decisions will matter life death was moved well statements made our colleague senator collins very much along same lines want repeat some what said again hope our colleagues will listen both them said expert may say global challenges this country faces now t]he secretary going facing number incredibly complex problems are going require highly skilled management ability concerned hegseth does not have management experience background will need order tackle these difficulties also concerned about multiple statements including some months just before was nominated hegseth made about women serving military had candid conversation december about his past statements apparently evolving views not convinced his position women serving combat roles has changed some ways nub problem what has said how has failed past management positions how lacks credibility manager leader senator collins continues women compromise nearly percent our active-duty military continue make critical valuable contributions our national defense have long advocated women who wish serve can meet rigorous standards combat roles should able numerous women have proved can accomplish this difficult feat currently thousands women are serving combat roles many others serve noncombat functions their service essential success our military hegseth also appears lack sufficient appreciation for some policies military required follow because are codified laws united states america while understand his point importance up-to-date workable rules engagement our prohibitions against torture come from american laws treaties ratified united states including geneva conventions therefore will vote against nomination hegseth has demeaned dismissed importance geneva conventions fact has berated lawyers department defense who set standards guidelines for what can done will never forget talking our former colleague--our great colleague friend mentor me--john mccain about why opposed torture waterboarding--that kind physical abuse--and why believed these laws have followed our military not just matter humanity but effective military strategy torturing gain information often produces false information but also reduces quality our military performance yet hegseth seems dismiss those ideas about geneva conventions about standards for military conduct categorically does many other standards should apply hope colleagues will listen senator murkowski senator collins because their statements say more effectively than this lengthier talk floor how important vote against hegseth future our national defense much has been written about him urge colleagues review article appeared new yorker--``pete hegseth's secret history''--by jane mayer which talks about some these instances not anonymous smears said many them were but sourced substantiated account kinds misconduct were detailed whistleblower report other documents--again not anonymous smear but specific explicit facts were claimed don't have eyewitness proof sworn testimony before armed services committee but this report powerful what shows hope colleagues hours have left before will vote again hegseth's nomination will reconsider perhaps their vote earlier today will recognize will responsible things wrong hope god always nothing goes wrong especially all who have family members who have served--mine u.s marine corps oldest son combat veteran second son michael navy seal responsibility secretary defense order men women into harm's way

january senate pages s313-s317 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov nomination peter hegseth mrs shaheen president come floor today address some concerns about qualifications president's nominee lead department defense pete hegseth like many colleagues armed services committee left hegseth's hearing last week with number unanswered questions some real concerns about his qualifications abilities serve role secretary defense now every single nominee for secretary defense from both democrat republican administrations has met with other members both sides aisle committee before their confirmation hearings voted for every one those nominees from both democrat republican administrations--secretaries panetta hagel carter mattis esper austin didn't always agree with their views their policies but thought all had qualifications temperament secretary defense supported their nominations but hegseth chose not meet with with any other senate democrat except ranking member jack reed broke with strong longstanding tradition ensure our work national security remains free from partisanship think important point are stronger senators congress nation are acting together committee unfortunately was not afforded opportunity ask number rounds questions there were number questions about his views particularly regarding foreign policy military policy did not get answer have become ranking member foreign relations committee very concerned about role united states world think american people expect transparency regarding hegseth's ability stand our allies partners uphold international agreements abide rules engagement and--the bottom line--to support men women military way not only keeps safe but protects them well almost million men women who serve our nation uniform deserve secretary defense who will not needlessly throw them harm's way seek divide them with partisan politics would like address few issues now were not able get hearing because were not able ask more than one round questions want start with role our alliances our allies partners play our own national security believe--and have seen many times from start this nation--that are stronger safer when lead together with our allies are fortunate because have strong allies partners don't see coming from vladimir putin from china don't see from north koreans iranians but united states has strong allies who can stand with most important security agreement have had think any time our nation's history has been with nato nato critical indispensable part our national security yet president's nominee for secretary defense wrote his book american crusade nato relic should scrapped since his nomination hegseth has tried walk back his opposition one our key international alliances nato advance policy questions from committee calls nato vital u.s interest defending europe american interests from russia vladimir putin this sudden reversal welcomed because think very important our secretary defense understands how critical nato stronger now than has been any time since was formed probably now have members nato but hegseth's eleventh hour conversion understanding importance our allies partners raises questions about what really believes asked our questions for record about nato didn't get much response now had had opportunity would have also brought ukraine hegseth's head-spinning contradictions this matter just america's national security interests are not trifled with neither should our commitment defending democracy international world order any inconsistency commitment--let start again because this really important any inconsistency our commitment support our allies partners support democracy around world support international world order going seen exploited our adversaries again puzzled how should think about hegseth's contradictory positions variety national security foreign policy issues for example was critical biden administration have many been both sides aisle this chamber for not moving fast enough aid ukraine but then questioned wisdom sending any u.s assistance ukraine all 2022 hegseth called vladimir putin war criminal called for faster u.s aid ukraine now says idea russia's launching nuclear war overinflated plays page s314 down severity conflict merely being putin's give shit back war well don't think our nato allies--those baltics poland eastern europe--think about vladimir putin's nuclear ambitions overinflated know threat poses their countries world flippant about threat nuclear war think beneath office secretary defense which will have engage with our partners regular basis now agree with president trump american people want see resolution this yearslong war sure true ukrainians well but hegseth has not either his hearing response questions submitted him for record expanded what department defense's role should with respect ukraine even though have already invested billion military assistance again think very important stand our ally ukraine because message sends not just russians vladimir putin but because message sends china iranians north koreans anyone who adversary united states think are going walk away from our allies are going everything can divide afghanistan hegseth has also been inconsistent his views president's foreign policy actually has been inconsistent general president's foreign policies lead-up 2016 election hegseth was highly critical then-candidate trump's foreign policy stances particularly iraq afghanistan hegseth called trump who was candidate time all bluster very little substance armchair tough guy criticized then-candidate trump 2015 for advocating for withdrawal forces from afghanistan but then took criticism back sharply criticized 2021 afghanistan withdrawal did but has failed publicly comment president trump's deal with taliban which what set date certain for withdrawal 2021 then biden administration was actually tied now agree agree withdrawal was not what wanted see--i didn't support it--but were terms president trump his first term set with taliban--terms thought gave away store taliban because there were concessions from them what were get for united states government afghanistan was not table when terms were negotiated now are seeing fallout from know one watching for gaps u.s national security policy more closely than president people's republic china hegseth identifies china our peer competitor--something think all armed services committee probably everyone this chamber agrees with but hegseth concerned about china then should realize nothing will encourage president xi's aggression more than seeing america abandon our allies partners hegseth sees china's ambitions fait accompli yet doesn't seem recognize his own inconsistencies all these foreign policy positions could contribute this question would like hegseth attempt answer what message would send our adversaries united states ceases its support not just for ukraine but for international rules norms underpin global order also concerned about with respect conduct conflict his book war warriors hegseth argued our boys should not fight rules written dignified men mahogany rooms years ago america should fight its own rules well rules talking about are geneva conventions which established bare minimum protections against violence torture inhumane treatment don't just protect those people who are fighting battlefield protect american soldiers during his hearing hegseth doubled down say restrictive rules engagement have made more difficult defeat our enemies would his priority lawyers aren't getting way well unfortunately dangerously this appears one few issues hegseth consistent has documented history supporting individuals who have violated military international law committing war crimes these are individuals who were turned not our enemies but members their own units were convicted crimes our own military juries--individuals for whom hegseth lobbied get pardons don't think can afford entrust safety success our men women uniform man who would himself disregard laws armed conflict leave american credibility moral authority tatters world stage while embracing officers convicted war crimes hegseth has stated his intent review all general officers currently serving department defense when asked would remove current chairman joint chiefs staff hegseth responded record all senior officers will reviewed let's just think about what means subjecting our general officers our military not politicized political litmus test not only unprecedented dangerous will convey american public their leadership political one most important roles secretary defense seek out consider open honest direct military advice from senior officers charge our forces don't know how hegseth expects receive open honest advice from his commanders when advocating for purge anyone who disagrees with him also deeply troubled idea hegseth would act yes-man himself putting his own personal political interests above well-being our military men women hegseth's confirmation hearing when asked what would received orders from president trump knew illegal unconstitutional hegseth wouldn't give straight answer all could was deny president trump was capable giving illegal order just for record clear his first term president trump did give illegal order then-secretary esper refused follow for secretary esper was fired president very concerned hegseth lacks consistency moral clarity lead most combat-credible military world very disappointed this body would put nominee floor without due process advice consent position secretary defense deserves our men women uniform deserve better therefore for first time since was elected represent people new hampshire u.s senate plan vote against this nominee for secretary defense yield floor presiding officer hagerty senator from rhode island reed president first want commend senator shaheen for typically thoughtful compelling speech concerning proposed nomination hegseth secretary defense will follow rising express opposition pete hegseth's nomination secretary defense hegseth ninth defense secretary nominee have considered member armed services committee have voted favor all his predecessors including those first trump administration while some former secretaries have disagreed politically there was always understanding partisanship has place when comes providing for our men women uniform indeed weight this position--secretary defense--is enormous secretary responsible for leading department 3\1 million servicemembers civilians annual budget nearly 900 billion hundreds thousands aircraft ships submarines combat vehicles satellites our nuclear arsenal also play powerful role with allies partners adversaries abroad having page s315 meet communicate coordinate with whole range individuals from many different ethnic groups many different religious groups part role secretary defense bare minimum former secretaries defense have had experience wisdom character job hegseth however simply not qualified meet overwhelming demands secretary defense last week armed services committee held nomination hearing for hegseth during hearing colleagues raised number concerning reports about him variety sources including his own writings implicate him with disregarding laws war financial mismanagement racist sexist remarks about men women uniform alcohol abuse sexual assault sexual harassment other troubling issues instead addressing these reports many which are documented record dodged deferred did not attempt alleviate fears colleagues have there blackmail material pattern abuse his personal history could used adversaries try influence him try deflect him from his sworn obligations duties united states frankly embarrass him secretary defense these reports are unlike anything have seen for nominee this importance are confirmed would undermine his ability effective leader have said for months critical fbi trump transition team carry out exhaustive background investigation hegseth regard must say extremely disappointed investigation process before hegseth's hearing was briefed transition team findings background check was alarmed investigators had neglected contact critical witnesses whistleblowers urged them reopen investigation during experience armed services committee unprecedented fbi has returned office two more times--as recently last night--to provide additional information nominee frankly still not believe background investigation complete last week after hearing was made aware individual with disturbing information about hegseth has been interviewed fbi december part background investigation however their testimony was not adequately included briefing provided trump transition team such asked this individual recount directly testimony had provided fbi was disturbed what received earlier this week armed services committee received sworn affidavit from pete hegseth's former sister-in-law alleges specific incidents hegseth's alcohol abuse threatening abusive behavior toward his second wife repeated pattern offensive public misconduct affidavit was signed sworn under penalty perjury has been made available all senators review hope will share few examples from her sworn testimony which gave fbi investigators once while drunk uniform--which violation military law hegseth was inebriated his brother had carry him out minneapolis strip club this occurred during drill weekend with minnesota national guard fbi was also told hegseth's second wife had escape plan involved texting safe word her friends family urgently request help without putting herself more danger this escape plan was executed least one occasion least one occasion his second wife hid her closet out fear many detailed examples fbi was told hegseth regularly became drunk passed out vomited had carried out family events public settings sometimes shouting sexually racially offensive comments point this know pete hegseth's former sister-in-law testified fbi about his history abuse alcoholism disgraceful public behavior however know now her testimony was not adequately included trump transition team's background briefing senate this begs question what else missing from fbi report senate not considering low-level appointee right now are advising consenting nominee for secretary defense cannot risk installing leader who may have history exploitable our adversaries nor can risk confirming secretary defense who has shown incapable being responsible accountable law-abiding hours day days week job requires addition hegseth's troubling personal conduct also have grave concerns about actions would take secretary defense during his nomination hearing asked hegseth about disturbing efforts underway within department defense intimidate military personnel their families reports trump administration may implement so-called purge board screen senior military officers for unfitness lead this raises chilling possibility trump administration may fire officers who are deemed have wrong political view believe tuesday firing u.s coast guard commandant adm linda fagan who all objective accounts was admirable leader proves purge underway unfortunately hegseth would not categorically condemn those efforts during his hearing instead talked about meritocracy restoring accountability within senior ranks military senate confirms hegseth this week who will fired department defense next week doubt very seriously will based upon merit anything else other than political agenda would beginning unraveling core element our military not political serves neither party nor person protects defends constitution united states will have something think key our success not only military force but nation despite hegseth's comment u.s military already one finest meritocracies world every member military their position because their ability are chosen boards other senior officers who evaluate their performance who look closely what have done render their best professional opinion capability person move assume particular job every member military their position because their ability when there always possibility need count person next save your life there other choice but meritocracy value there other choice must can make other than pick someone whose focus whose heart whose spirit protect their fellow soldiers sailors marines airmen guardians--not exploit them make judgment about their colleagues not based their political affiliations but fact are fellow soldier sailor airman see dangerous dangerous point which will divert from this historic compelling approach become political organization have seen happen other places around world where militaries are undermined subjected political leaders who have particular political point view passion become essentially not army but extension political aspirations great leader can't see here america our present servicemembers can should confident with hard work skill character will successful their military careers key criteria indeed this very meritocracy would prevent person like hegseth from rising higher ranks military totality his own writings conduct would disqualify any servicemember from holding any leadership position military much less being confirmed secretary defense there was evidence serving officer military was drunk page s316 uniform strip club there was evidence senior military officer was engaged sexual relations while married another woman having just fathered child from another woman can guarantee officer's career would end swiftly either resignation court martial moreover our servicemembers since birth this country 249 years ago have taken oath constitution their mission protect country all its citizens ideals this country was founded which should endure matter who president what political party power hegseth's idea meritocracy however seems servicemembers should pledge fealty president who will power for only years fit ideas party only half this nation supports there faster way undermine lethality morale our nation's military--and support nation's citizens for it--than inject politics into system hegseth confirmed will not improve our military but destabilize weaken institution further during his hearing hegseth failed convince many colleagues capable running any organization remotely complex department defense hegseth has been head two separate veterans organizations from 2008 through 2010 led organization veterans for freedom which had annual budget less than million each year was charge outlays exceeded revenues until organization verged bankruptcy had merged with another group from 2011 until 2016 hegseth ran organization concerned veterans for america during each those years tax records show organization spent more than raised this how hegseth manages organizations with comparatively small staff budget how can anyone have confidence will able effectively manage organization with hundreds multi million multi-billion-dollar contracts literally drive economy many parts this country confirmed hegseth would leader millions men women every race religion political belief can only effective leader effective fighting force has respect for those leads trust supports them unfortunately hegseth has shown disdain outright hostility for many would lead his writings his speeches make clear his opposition diversity issues has said diversity not our strength unity recent podcast said i'm straight just saying should not have women combat roles hegseth has also written other side left not our friend are not esteemed colleagues nor mere political opponents are foes either agree nothing else not spirit bring lead men women our military forces when joined army young officer 1970s u.s military was rife with racial tension women were prohibited from serving most roles gay servicemembers were banned relied national draft fill our ranks soldiers served with were proud but was certainly not nation's most capable military any standard have made great progress since then today department defense fully integrated every race religion accepted women serve all combat roles leadership positions sexual orientation irrelevant service all-volunteer force visibly reflects nation protects our military more diverse than has ever been but more importantly more lethal than has ever been this not coincidence this diversity nonpartisanship bedrock our military power but hegseth seeks destroy one other strength u.s military which has made respected around world adherence rule law clear standards battlefield protect civilians treat prisoners with humanity once again this nominee for secretary defense confirmed will put principle doubt hegseth has championed pardoning military members who were turned their fellow soldiers seals well military contractors convicted killing iraqi civilians without cause has advocated for reinstitution interrogation methods like waterboarding have been defined torture has belittled advice counsel judge advocates general while deployment his book war warriors wrote should follow geneva conventions our warriors are forced follow rules arbitrarily asked sacrifice more lives international tribunals feel better about themselves aren't just better off winning our wars according our own rules how can our military personnel trust each other partners allies need this dangerous world trust united states such rules conventions are tossed aside what bounty this would give our adversaries how would have moral authority criticize north vietnamese for example who tortured pilots like our colleague john mccain our secretary defense saying waterboarding perfectly fine wouldn't fact think our pilots would very much concerned felt there are rules game went down behind enemy lines would just brutalized tortured cetera don't even have moral objection finally top priority u.s senator has always been national security colleagues hope know this don't seek partisan wins political spotlight want right our men women uniform refuse compromise cut corners national security issues greatest privilege have had life lead soldiers understand respect them best example leadership would have confidence their best interest was sole interest not what heard from hegseth not what would bring department defense process important for nomination this sort other than hegseth refused meet with any democratic colleagues committee--an unprecedented act signal not trying nonpartisan secretary fact going very partisan again injecting politics into department defense which view fatal committee was denied second round questioning hegseth although needed time should point out historically when secretary hagel was here had three rounds questioning when secretary carter was here had two rounds questioning precedent was strongly favor additional round have essentially been denied kind access would have revealed more hegseth's qualities conduct thoughts not appropriate said previously fbi background check was inadequate again first time have ever had background check supplemented two additional addendums background check not way have experienced this would hope colleagues are bit alarmed are asking themselves does this individual have character competence composure secretary defense frankly not convinced stunned many respects lack scrutiny which too many colleagues are using consider this nomination lives thousands thousands men women uniform security our nation--and indeed world--is stake hope will all take time reflect whether are ready confirm hegseth secretary defense will personally urge colleagues vote against this nominee with president yield floor presiding officer senator from mississippi wicker president few moments senate will vote confirmation our next cia director then immediately following there will vote cloture nomination peter brian hegseth president donald trump's nominee for secretary defense going page s317 vote yes for cloture expect majority our senators will three months ago million americans voted for change united states sent president trump back white house was decisive victory clear mandate focus this nation prosperity peace work begins pentagon where must return policy peace through strength are facing most complex dangerous global security environment since world war next few years will shape direction for remainder 21st century could led united states future which would lead freedom prosperity for all americans absence armed conflict could led despots chinese communist party working against its dictator jinping uses military force economic coercion try reshape world order with help his junior partner kim jong-un north korea same time despot vladimir putin remains intent territorial expansion iran hamas hezbollah houthis their like continue attack israel united states isis remains set killing americans every day--every day unfortunately biden administration wasted precious time significant resources pursuing divisive social policies dod for instance just spent months organizing with administration over whether defense department should pay for hormone therapies puberty blockers for minors out taxpayer dollars seventy-one percent americans oppose policy including more than half democrats glad are going abandon type policy could but let now turn focusing future together congress president have lot don't have much time have broken shipbuilding industrial base fix have defense manufacturing jobs build munitions lines expand have ossified budgeting system update have got audit finish for first time decades have resourcing problem needs attention his way out door secretary austin now tells need spend lot more national security well thank secretary austin admission years too late are simply falling behind our adversaries too many ways president trump seeks reverse this trend bring much needed change pentagon has chosen man lead pentagon his choice spearhead these efforts pete hegseth retired major combat veteran army national guard admittedly this nomination unconventional nominee himself unconventional just like new york developer who rode down escalator 2015 announce his candidacy for president may what makes hegseth good choice not beholden status quo open new ideas intent lethality readiness shouldn't all his experience line fire his servicemember advocacy make least one thing clear pete hegseth will put men women our military first congress has often seen defense secretaries delay evade congressional oversight think pete hegseth will willing eager partner with regard last week senate armed services committee convened consider hegseth's nomination testimony lasting nearly hours addressed three key audiences our committee u.s senate whole american people think american people liked what saw know did showed each why president trump chose him next secretary defense first all articulated clear vision pentagon clear anyone who listened going bring energy fresh ideas shake department's stagnant bureaucracy will restore warfighting ethos relentlessly focus military's core mission defer conflict necessary war hegseth committed bringing swift end corrosive social policies serve divide our servicemembers rather than unite them have pointed out earlier american people are behind him this regard overwhelmingly correctly stated need change way pentagon does business will restore culture accountability cutting redtape incentivizing innovation rebuilding defense industrial base affirmed his intent tackle hardest systemic problems plague pentagon challenges previous secretaries have proven unable fix mentioned audit sincerely believe will get audit done under his oversight importantly agreed maintaining inadequate biden-era defense budget levels would dangerous our national security hear said outgoing secretary admitting very thing his testimony before our committee hegseth said this only special interest is--the warfighter deterring wars called upon winning wars ensuring our warriors never enter fair fight let them then bring them home well put major hegseth confident hegseth supported team experienced top officials will exactly pete his family have endured numerous smears false news stories less reported outpouring support this nominee has received pete hegseth has devoted his career fighting for his fellow soldiers his fellow soldiers--men women--are now speaking out his behalf past few months host flag officers signed open letter enthusiastically

war these officer must have but final test his ability not what knows but what there substitute for those innate qualities which generally refer character fellow senators put aside nominee's lack knowledge lack experience prepare him for role this magnitude must also consider this nominee's absence character becoming secretary defense heard his confirmation hearings have heard described colleagues today have seen television read about materials have been provided demonstrates hegseth's unfitness for this office character matters--it does still does amount tough talk bromides about

our children deserve better exactly what are giving them today colleague from colorado speaks daca 537,000 daca recipients this nation there not one under age fact 537,000 recipients there are only

her love for lord today honor laken ensure with this commonsense approach targeted making sure our communities are safe secure other family has through heartbreak laken's did ultimately have say this amendment therefore object presiding officer objection heard senator from colorado bennet president thank senator from alabama for her work senate floor for coming over know this big day around senate big day for america appropriate think should here this issue today because over coming months years are going confronting lot choices make think critically important make these choices way consistent with our values throughout our history generations americans have tried secure our heritage nation immigrants nation committed rule law both those are important when have fallen short which have from time time have battled back reclaim these moral values our enduring commitment this imperfect but principled work why 21st century america has one most dynamic economies vibrant cultures important reputation throughout world beacon freedom reputation way not assured reputation has earned our nation every single day although our founders were famously suspicious overreaching federal government recognized obvious national imperatives national security foreign policy imperatives--and problems would arise every state county city were enforce its own immigration laws why constitution united states says congress working with president should administer those laws therefore logically assigned responsibility our national government--not our state government not our local government--to enforce our immigration law throughout our history american people have been welcoming new immigrants--and sometimes less understandably chaotic changing circumstances like ones face today sometimes raise alarms among american people unfortunately page s248 our time--and would agree with senator from alabama this--we have not addressed chaos southern border united states politicians have used this crisis for years divide american people one side partisan divide another result failing immigration system have has only become more broken thing want make sure think about chaos are facing complexity are facing don't--as have occasionally past--abandon our values our commitment rule law more inspired times have used these crises actually burnish our great global advantage nation immigrants committed rule law 2013 had what was view important chance embrace those values with senate's work gang senator alabama might remember her seems like ancient history was one members gang was lot younger than today were other members gang too but seriously tried take meaningful immigration reform this chamber had tough but fair pathway citizenship for those who could earn united states included dream act had massive overhaul--massive overhaul--of our visa system our farms ranches high-tech industries even our ski industry could continue compete with rest world had billion border security money there--i hate think what money was real dollars today what billion would look like today bet around billion--that people this chamber agreed support together there was much money bill lindsey graham--senator graham from south carolina who was another member gang used say there were going many border patrol agents could literally hold hands from one end border other across united states america can see senator from alabama has heard story before there has been huge cost inaction not just money had spent then would have made such huge difference but painful consequences senator from alabama others have talked about have talked about for american people for our country end after months going through legislative wringer mentioned got votes over here senate had been given chance--read speaker boehner's book will tell this had gone floor would have gotten majority vote floor senate but freedom caucus killed bill legislative back alley before could see light day house floor since then like with many american people's most fundamental concerns federal government this congress has been immobilized subject immigration for sure under both republican democratic presidents meantime transnational gangs have seized full opportunity our inaction raking billions dollars smuggling human beings drugs weapons southern border united states these criminal syndicates have perfected their worldwide smuggling operations have trained people how exploit our asylum system have weaponized social media enable thousands people travel all over globe present themselves southern border united states come through southern border result paralysis has been times overwhelmed southern border for this reason 2022 urged biden administration never lift title without plan without resources execute were unprepared for what was come were too slow act clear almost everybody today our system isn't built for today's conditions need fix need give american people confidence have fair secure system place how well tonight are going vote first response from congress laken riley act which think neither focused driving resources border establishing more robust rigorous system immigration instead contrary our constitutional obligation today's bill devolves authority away from president congress state attorneys general ways seem extremely counterproductive hope not right about this although can already see battle brewing administration about this this bill provides state attorneys general power seek nationwide injunctions completely block certain countries like india china salvador from sending immigrants here imagine salvadorian farmworker h-2a visa living florida louisiana committing violent crime leading deportation order should deported not here dispute don't dispute but with this bill salvador doesn't accept his deportation florida's attorney general could ask court force federal government ban all visas from salvador all h-2a visas all h-1b visas for high-tech workers for all matters nearly 5,500 people colorado today are working h-2a visa why should florida's attorney general able dictate colorado's need for these workers why should any state attorney general able hammer economies other states doesn't make any sense because congress administration have abandoned their responsibility here find ourselves this position second this bill creates mandatory detention policies for immigrants accused committing nonviolent also violent crime said believe should going after transnational gangs street gangs people who pose threat our community when brutal crime committed case laken riley should respond have respond should stand with her family--as senator from alabama has done--and her community ensure something like never happens again but opinion this bill not targeted enough would force ice working with local law enforcement detain immigrants who are accused--not just convicted but accused--of very broad set crimes including shoplifting without regard how young are more important whether are threat our community threat public safety there good reason--and know presiding officer may not agree with this but know knows logic there good reason why seldom pass legislation with mandatory detention jailing tend believe law enforcement best position determine realtime who threat public safety actually know don't have resources--we never have resources--to lock every nonviolent offender without regard whether are threat public safety not know this sounds crazy but this bill broadly drafted would compel law enforcement put mandatory detention on--you heard it--an 11-year-old immigrant new york accused stealing soda from gas station think most law enforcement agents across country would tell their time would much better spent tracking down detaining for example violent criminal who has bludgeoned their neighbor with hammer but this bill doesn't distinguish between those two cases instead strips law enforcement their ability make their best judgment about whom arrest not arrest whom detain not detain how focus their precious resources protecting our public safety proponents this bill not deny children will swept its administration this not drafting error this bill every undocumented person accused--not just convicted but accused--of list crimes this bill must detained might sound like law order page s249 but easy see how this encroachment law enforcement's ability its job could spiral out control make matters even worse this bill does not provide ice with resources needs implement what now massive unfunded liability know proponents bill say are going fix problem but just understand ice says this bill going cost billion year their number have heard much higher numbers than let's take their number billion year three times ice's annual budget billion many are used congress passing bills without ever paying for them but this may one worst cases have seen know there may attempt here through reconciliation--you know tax measure try fund this some way pick some other place it--but choices are going have made between mandatory detention people who may not threat our community other choices like funding for border patrol countering weapons mass destruction office homeland security disaster relief fund--just three come mind put another way every dollar ice spends incarcerating kids dollar border patrol doesn't have spend border itself wouldn't american people lot better off homeland security were left focus violent criminals enforcing border not kids accused nonviolent crimes assume one here really thinks mandatorily incarcerating children accused nonviolent crimes best most strategic way fix our immigration system certainly don't want repeat images children caged chain-link enclosures screaming out for their parents federal law enforcement does not want repeat least all least anybody doubt any would want private prisons managing outcome either episode was shameful part our history falls into chapter our history another one our more shameful immigration failures congress has never addressed status dreamers senator from alabama made this point when said there isn't dreamer country less than years old because notwithstanding american people's overwhelming support for dreamers who know country other than united states have been unable rationalize their presence country but million dreamers--who after all these years are now middle age nurses teachers small business owners with families their own--are also vulnerable presiding officer senator your time has expired bennet president ask for additional minutes presiding officer without objection ordered bennet can make this bill better stronger focusing actual threats public safety protecting nonviolent kids from getting locked stripped away from their parents schools churches communities can make this bill better protecting nonviolent dreamers from mandatory incarceration only country know know time almost over american people want fix our broken immigration system want feel safe our own country want secure border cut down illegal border crossings want strengthen rigorous legal pathways support our economy attract top talent want improve our partnerships with other countries there reason for people stay home not just come here fix our broken immigration system most americans

distinguished colleague from wisconsin walk who has tried bring attention this tried make sure had hearing 88,000-plus children have been under this previous administration look additionally when talk about ice there are 6,000 ice officers interior our country have over million migrants have come here illegally over 7.8 are actually removal proceedings over 1.4 million have been given their final

iowa amendment ernst president rise support laken riley act ask fellow colleagues vote for amendment sarah's law combined these actions will close loopholes for too long have allowed murderers who come here illegally roam free our communities commit more crimes these two young women sarah root laken riley their families deserve justice folks can make this happen tonight after all this not

arizona but new york georgia pennsylvania yes folks even iowa end this month marks years since iowan's michelle root scott root whom know personally woke every parent's worst nightmare their daughter sarah was killed drunk driver who was illegal immigrant sarah 21-year-old from council bluffs had just graduated from bellevue university nebraska with 4.0 gpa was headed home after celebrating this milestone--a very important day her life--with her family friends instant illegal immigrant edwin mejia who was drunk-driving with blood alcohol three times legal limit struck killed her one would think sarah's killer would clearly meet immigration customs enforcement's enforcement priorities but no--no citing obama administration's november 2014 memo ice declined take custody mejia yes folks had killed woman declined take custody edwin mejia despite his repeated driving offenses history skipping court dates before root family could even lay sarah rest her satin lined casket cold iowa ground her murderer had posted bond never seen again never face justice since then have warned repeatedly against dangers letting illegal immigrants who have already broken our laws roam country continue their lawlessness loophole law meant sarah's killer escaped justice but today can something ensure other family has through pain grief scott michelle scotty rest their family still feel from heartbreaking day amendment would close alarming page s250 loophole let sarah's killer free would simply require ice detain illegal immigrants charged with killing seriously injuring another person

submitted following resolution which was referred committee judiciary resolution expunging december 2019 impeachment president donald john trump whereas president trump was wrongfully accused misconduct house resolution 755 impeaching donald john trump president united states for high crimes misdemeanors demonstrated information revealed unclassified fd-1023 fbi document now therefore resolved december 2019 impeachment president donald john trump expunged such articles had never passed full house representatives facts circumstances upon which such articles were based did not meet burden proving commission high crimes misdemeanors set forth section article constitution all congressional bills 119th congress from u.s government publishing office res introduced house doc 119th congress 1st session res expunging january 2021 impeachment president donald john trump house representatives january greene georgia for herself mrs miller illinois weber texas collins crane malliotakis moylan nehls mrs luna van drew submitted following resolution which was referred committee judiciary resolution expunging january 2021 impeachment president donald john trump whereas constitution provides house representatives shall have sole power impeachment president shall removed from office impeachment for conviction treason bribery other high crimes misdemeanors whereas january 2021 house representatives passed res agreeing article resolution impeaching donald john trump president united states for high crimes misdemeanors vote 232 yeas 197 nays not voting whereas article resolution entitled incitement insurrection contains subjective account which transpired capitol january 2021 whereas article resolution omits any discussion circumstances unusual voting patterns voting anomalies presidential election itself whereas prior considering voting impeachment resolution democratic leadership house made effort understand rationale behind widespread mistrust harbored american voters wake presidential election whereas president trump bellwether counties across country have predicted winner every presidential election since 1980 whereas president trump received approximately 10,100,000 more votes than 2016 presidential election making president trump first incumbent president 132 years since grover cleveland's failed bid for reelection 1888 have increased his vote from his initial election seemingly still not reelection subsequent cycle whereas secretaries state state boards election across country changed state election laws sua sponte name health safety wake covid-19 pandemic whereas public officials numerous states issued guidance counties local election officials were precluded from performing on-the-spot signature analysis ensuring absentee ballots could not rejected because election official believed voter's signature ballot envelope did not match signature file whereas four democratic lawmakers senators warren klobuchar wyden representative pocan formerly enthusiastic proponents voting machine integrity went far send 2019 letter voting system companies providing real examples voting machine problems such switching votes rejecting paper ballots vulnerability cyberattack yet following presidential election any individual who raised same concerns was dismissed democrats pundits mainstream media spreading misinformation being nothing more than conspiracy theorist whereas recount efforts following presidential election were vociferously opposed governors secretaries state key swing states like arizona pennsylvania michigan wisconsin georgia whereas public officials key swing states ignored took great steps resist calls for accountability transparency election administration counting recounting ballots their respective states further sowing seed doubt electorate legitimacy fairness final result whereas rather than setting forth facts evidence supporting need impeach president matter days before leaves office article resolution cites two quotes from president trump's january 2021 speech ellipse lack any context are viewed light most unfavorable president whereas article resolution grasps fact president trump stated this election landslide well don't fight like hell you're not going have country anymore undeniable evidence high crimes misdemeanors were committed president trump engaged insurrection rebellion against united states whereas article resolution conveniently fails mention fact president trump explicitly stated know everyone here will soon marching over capitol building peacefully patriotically make your voices heard whereas consideration resolution house representatives failed follow any meaningful legislative process whatsoever whereas not single evidentiary hearing resolution was held witnesses were heard process opportunity respond was provided president trump whereas members congress were provided opportunity review amend resolution before came before full house representatives for consideration whereas committee rules house representatives only committee published official committee report for resolution being report accompanying res rule providing for floor consideration resolution whereas while majority staff report was released democrats house committee judiciary committee did not issue official committee report via regular order for res resolution itself whereas failing issue committee report for res conveniently precluded house judiciary committee republicans forum which may have showcased their dissenting views resolution whereas assert lone committee report accompanying procedural rule for floor consideration provided sufficient due process trump administration american people via their elected representatives assert voting yea resolution was justified runs contrary oath office taken all members house representatives whereas neither committee report issued committee rules house representatives nor text impeachment resolution itself contain any mention text section article constitution which provides judgment cases impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office whereas plain reading text section article constitution demonstrates official tried convicted senate must first occupy office from which removed let alone forever disqualified from hold[ing any office under united states whereas frantically passing impeachment resolution january 2021 only days after was introduced frenzy hysteria house democrats house republicans left senate only one week conduct complete trial convict president trump before left office whereas doing left senate virtually chance comport with section article constitution whereas unsurprisingly days passed before senate held vote failed convict president trump days after had left office whereas further indication partisan political motivations behind resolution once article impeachment was passed house representatives transmitted senate chief justice supreme court refused serve presiding officer for trial required section article constitution instead senate president pro tempore senator pat leahy democrat from vermont reliably partisan politician served presiding officer perfecting entirety process nothing more than unconstitutional exercise futility moot fantastical political theater now therefore resolved january 2021 impeachment president donald john trump expunged such article had never passed full house representatives facts circumstances upon which such article was based met burden proving neither president trump committed high crimes misdemeanors set forth section article constitution nor president trump engaged insurrection rebellion against united states such forever precluded from hold[ing any office

rules committee but worth noting since house last considered this bill has been altered with increasingly ironic amendment amendment added mandatory imprisonment for people accused assaulting law enforcement officer say this amendment ironic because yesterday just hours after taking oath office president trump granted mass pardons for over 1,200 january maga rioters who had been convicted president trump also ordered dismissal cases hundreds more including hundreds who assaulted police officers with bats poles page h273 bear spray explosives other weapons over 140 officers were hurt

sustaining injuries horrific trauma hands fellow citizens during maga attack january 2021 issuing those pardons president trump put presidential seal approval political violence long supports him even directed against law enforcement just clear there was case-by-case review these convictions this blanket pardon are already seeing fruits incredibly dangerous act pardoning people who attacked constitution this capitol police officers people within among those attackers are dangerous felons who are not chastened remorseful reformed feel emboldened one them daniel charles ball has just been

deeply discouraged recent pardons commutations granted both biden trump administrations individuals convicted killing assaulting law enforcement officers iacp fop firmly believe those convicted such crimes should serve their full sentences crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks individuals public safety--they are attacks society undermine rule law allowing those convicted these crimes released early diminishes accountability devalues sacrifices made courageous law enforcement officers their families when perpetrators crimes especially serious crimes are not held fully accountable sends dangerous message consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe potentially emboldening others commit similar acts violence iacp fop call policymakers judicial authorities community leaders ensure justice upheld enforcing full sentences especially cases involving violence against law enforcement this approach reaffirms our commitment rule law public safety protection those who risk their lives for our communities austin scott georgia speaker reserve balance time mcgovern speaker may inquire how much time remaining speaker pro tempore gentleman from

majority nearly 100 years one would think given closeness election would hear more about importance working together bipartisanship but would wrong reflected this rules package speaker truly unbelievable are this moment right now are down here debating revision revision rules package this time again after republicans worked out another backroom deal what concessions were important bring house standstill while redrafted their package once again last-minute addition were all just sitting around waiting for says bipartisan suspension bills can't debated thursdays fridays never mind there emergency like national disaster terror attack can't move quickly actually why this extreme republican majority wants make this change hate bipartisanship hate bipartisanship what was change made earlier today what was big emergency changing words like child son daughter our ethics rules are obsessed with this stuff not just weird discrimination meanwhile few months ago received over rule change proposals our member day hearing rules committee zero zero--of them are included this package instead get some last minute backroom deal time 1645 would love hear why those ideas were all blocked but don't even have rules committee chair ask have idea where any this came from had time review all forget about 72-hour rule didn't even get minutes are already making mockery legislative process said don't have chair rules committee usually this moment would congratulate new chair rules committee but are very odd situation not having chair rules committee right now think just one small sign disarray dysfunction have been seeing around here for last few years are debating rules package republicans don't even have chair rules committee place who wrote this maybe gentlewoman can tell who wrote these rules maybe can tell who decided block dozens amendments from both sides aisle many bipartisan amendments which were blocked with explanation all know was done back room somewhere with accountability about all know speaking back rooms only reason speaker johnson got enough votes because two members emerged from back room after huddling with speaker changed their votes support him god only knows what were promised order cave change their views for last years all american people have been asking work together get stuff done what radical idea actually working together getting stuff accomplished for american people want reject extremism polarization very first thing this now even smaller republican majority decides into back room cave their most extreme members sadly not surprised wanted believe maybe after losing seats getting nothing done last congress just maybe would change clearly republicans have decided double down dysfunction buckle everybody because republican incompetence about reach staggering new heights two years ago other side promised openness transparency action instead look what delivered constant disarray never ending dysfunction complete total inaction why all this dysfunction because refuse work together with democrats instead working with shut this place down ran most closed congress history think about would rather shut out voices shut down ideas shut off debate silence democracy would rather than work together not what people voted for least not what people district voted for not exaggerating when say this republicans ran most closed congress history ever period allowed amendments most bills opportunity make bills better told american people take leave democracy damned talk about open process give break blocked 6,000 amendments over last years don't want hear any lectures about bipartisanship give break rejected percent bipartisan amendments how for bipartisanship speaker johnson even shut out his own members fifty-seven percent their own party's amendments were blocked open process open process foot this how run things kremlin not how should run here united states congress give break forgive skepticism when hear from friends other side aisle about bipartisanship fairness around here republicans have broken promise over over over look how much time wasted last congress while were waiting around for republicans fight with each other instead fighting for american people spent weeks wasting taxpayer time money because couldn't elect speaker not once but twice weeks wasted where congress didn't damn thing now have nerve lecture people about government efficiency come get real how many times last congress did just send everyone home because couldn't even pass their own bills how many times did miss their own deadlines when anything did get done was democrats who stepped get done hands down republicans ran most ineffective incompetent chaotic congress history would think republicans would reflect their failures maybe try work toward solving nation's pressing challenges would think but would wrong big republican change rules--this their grand idea--is shield speaker from accountability blocked dozens good rule changes were suggested members both parties but one big change made empower radical right page h16 apparently there not lot spine around here because speaker johnson like former speaker mccarthy picked extremism over compromise did anyone even bother ask kevin mccarthy how worked out for him first time speaker last time checked speaker house

additional republican cosponsors our prayers are with people california are enduring horrendous wildfires experiencing life property have unique opportunity today put feet those prayers prevent those tragedies from happening again future there are two reasons why can't afford wait any longer reform forest management policies this country number one stakes are too high number two what are doing not working first let's talk about stakes los angeles wildfires have caused unimaginable damage will likely become costliest american history with early estimates suggesting upward 250 billion damages more than 16,000 structures--homes schools grocery stores entire neighborhoods communities--have burned sadly least people have tragically their lives all know such figures can tell only part story price tag can placed beloved family member friend property valuation can register pain family feels after losing home where cherished memories were made bookkeeping accounts for dreams small business owner whose lifework has gone smoke these are true costs human costs catastrophic wildfire losing 16,000 structures nearly unfathomable local officials reported looked like bomb was dropped these communities after smoke had cleared what truly startling there are million homes wildland-urban interface nationwide there are more than 70,000 communities just like pacific palisades risk being wiped out catastrophic fire this brings second point what have been doing not working this bill passed house last september with strong bipartisan vote unfortunately senate failed move interim more than 1.5 million acres burned across country fix our forests act offers broad set commonsense solutions must enacted this legislation creates needed framework for prioritizing treatments our highest risk areas identify these areas fofa utilizes state-of-the-art technology determine most vulnerable firesheds across country then incentivizes use emergency actions prevent wildfires many these actions like clearing brush creating fuel breaks are exactly what local authorities hastily undertook scrambled save threatened neighborhoods los angeles key difference however this bill ensures such measures take place well before fires start not heat approaching blaze without these tools completing single forest management project takes average years under fofa land managers can act immediately protect communities fofa also expands existing categorical exclusions 10,000 acres prevention measures can meet scale crisis under status quo land managers want reduce hazardous fuels area roughly size palisades fire would need eight separate categorical exclusions under fofa need only two this change based proven results like 10,000-acre lake tahoe basin was bipartisan effort representative mcclintock late senator dianne feinstein these efforts saved south lake tahoe from certain destruction during caldor fire fofa also protects communities creating community wildfire risk reduction program clearing hazardous trees from utility rights-of way prevent fires like ones destroyed lahaina maui paradise california fofa supports wildland firefighters creating new casualty assistance program for firefighters killed injured line duty ensuring access latest technology can detect put out fires faster standardizing repayment timelines with local fire departments non-federal partners aren't waiting years get money are owed have only briefly described some important bipartisan pieces fofa but involves much more make forests more resilient healthier safer from sea shining sea all these tools available this bill echo similar theme must restore common sense our approach forest management this comprehensive package result years hard work bipartisan collaboration formulated through hearings site visits member feedback fixing our forests should not partisan issue today not chair urge colleagues support this bill reserve balance time huffman chair rise opposition h.r 471 fix our forests act sponsored chairman westerman while this bill flawed will discussing those flaws here moment appreciate chair westerman representative peters did come together work this issue bipartisan way acknowledges our wildfire crisis good thing addressing should bipartisan priority fix our forests act includes some helpful provisions for starters has incorporated number key democratic priorities are direct alignment with recommendations wildland fire mitigation management commission what referenced this poster here behind 148 nonpartisan consensus recommendations for making safer from threat wildfire this bill simply moved those consensus recommendations forward also did something commission told had critical priority which fund them make sure agencies responsible for overseeing these projects have staffing--if this bill were simply doing wouldn't here today because this bill would already law many these good things would already keeping communities safer chair will hear moment this bill goes off some tangents have nothing with fire safety also with respect good provisions does include fails fund them why are here why path this bill has been more complicated unfortunately missed opportunity were able this bill include reauthorization collaborative forest landscape restoration program joint chiefs landscape restoration partnership sponsored our newly reelected subcommittee federal lands ranking member joe neguse latest version bill also includes revamped version fireshed center which aligns with several commission's consensus recommendations aimed enhancing coordination using predictive services unifying decisionmaking capabilities glad this bill has evolved include these priorities democratic colleagues have championed fact have democratic bills all these good things more because fire safety huge concern for all but our democratic bills not pair these good provisions unnecessarily with harmful environmental rollbacks unfortunately what bill before does scratch beneath surface h.r 471 start seeing problems starting with fact beneficial provisions are totally unfunded page h314 there simply money resources help any good things actually happen there are also several poison pills have potential undermine science-based management public engagement top doing nothing address key driver catastrophic wildfires climate change so-called fix our forests act inappropriately co-opts emergency authorities under national environmental policy act undercuts endangered species act even makes more difficult for communities engage scrutinize even know about projects could directly impact them wildfire deadly serious matter minutes iconic landscapes entire neighborhoods can reduced ashes know because has happened all too often district not something politicians should use pretext jam through unrelated industry favors special interest agendas undermine our foundational environmental protections let clear house democrats agree need increase pace scale restoration our national forests public private land why worked secure robust funding infrastructure investment jobs act inflation reduction act this enabled biden-harris administration develop wildfire crisis strategy other key restoration activities thanks funding provided forest service has been able achieve record numbers for both hazardous fuels reduction prescribed burning have even identified southern california priority landscape through this work only thing holding them back from doing even more beneficial work ground lack money however are seeing with los angeles fires addressing wildfire crisis not all about work woods southern california dominated chaparral where things like timber sales clear cutting simply not provide fire safety solution for these communities republican friends seem think logging panacea for fire safety fact will little nothing reduce wildfire risk many most vulnerable communities fuel los angeles fires was not trees fuel was homes schools businesses will learn many lessons from this tragedy but one hope can take away right now can't keep taking siloed myopic approach wildfire management prevention built environments like los angeles must priority shouldn't have fight lies disinformation our brave federal firefighters who are already underpaid are out there still fighting fires would like set record straight some misinformation disinformation swirling around this debate while los angeles has some strongest building codes fire safety requirements nation there are still thousands thousands homes require retrofitting ensure are adequately protected clearly have lot more work this bill misses mark failing advance work keeping homes property resilient also requires constant upkeep maintenance our communities need guidance again more than anything else need resources ensure this happens while fix our forests act includes community wildfire risk program which good thing not enough need pass community protection wildfire resilience act introduced earlier this week with republican colleague congressman obernolte provides actual resources help local communities defend themselves from growing danger wildfires our bill would empower communities implement science-based methods for mitigating wildfire damage provide funding design implement new community protection wildfire resilience plans with community members first responders relevant state agencies would designate targeted specific grant program for home hardening within fema add home hardening allowable project under existing forest service program bill provides actual support with adequate focus built environment why filed amendment this bill unfortunately majority decided move forward this bill without allowing vote many other amendments had been hopeful amendment process would opportunity address some critical gaps this bill especially absence pay raise for our federal wildland firefighters too has been left out what happened los angeles this month national tragedy moments like this should overcome all politics find ways work together solutions actually help people are here serve with mind want discourage any colleagues other side aisle who might want embrace this wrongheaded idea relief support for los angeles can somehow bargaining chip used leverage advance other policy goals majority not going turn california into red state hijacking critically needed disaster relief fact thought like never would have crossed our minds when had backs people florida north carolina louisiana have simply been fellow americans helping each other face these terrible tragedies way has always worked this congress hope are not going set terrible new precedent now chair will recommending vote this bill today hope can continue work together however improve this bill address all critical issues have been left out also hope when comes broader critical need for federal disaster relief can remember are all fellow americans need have each other's backs these moments chair reserve balance time time 1245 westerman chair throwing money problem would fix then wouldn't having fires today over past few years our federal land managers have been showered with billion battle wildland fires make our forests more resilient result forest service estimates are going treat less acreage than treated before not money problem policy problem fix our forests will help solve problem chair yield 3\1/2 minutes gentleman from california mcclintock mcclintock chairman over last years have fully one-quarter our federal forests catastrophic fire untended forest different from untended garden will grow grow until chokes itself death then will succumb disease pestilence drought ultimately catastrophic fire this how nature gardens doesn't care takes century more for forest regrow mortals excess timber will come out forest only two ways either will carry out nature will burn out why created forest service our own gardening remove excess timber before can choke off forest every year foresters would mark off surplus timber would auction off logging companies who paid remove for century enjoyed healthy fire-resistant resilient forests however then passed bureaucratic laws which have made active management our forests all but impossible simple forest management plan now takes average 5.3 years complete costs millions dollars more than value timber harvested since these laws were passed timber harvested from federal lands california has fallen percent with concomitant increase acreage destroyed fire friend huffman concerned about climate change carbon dioxide should know ucla study revealed just fires california alone released twice much carbon dioxide had been page h315 prevented years restrictions regulations california has imposed costing its consumers taxpayers billions dollars now were able get categorical exclusion from nepa for forest thinning projects lake tahoe basin 2016 years since its enactment has reduced approval process for forest thinning projects tahoe from years less than months has reduced environmental reports from more than 800 pages down few dozen timber harvested has increased from roughly million board feet year million board feet year treated acreage has tripled tahoe forests are returning fire resiliency this what saved city south lake tahoe from caldor fire years ago town grizzly flats which was not protected this law was wiped out same fire have been trying for years expand these proven reforms rest national forest system through proven forest management act measure now included this legislation its enactment long overdue this should not partisan issue choice between policies have proven work policies have proven fail let return policies work before run out forests burn down huffman chair yield myself such time may consume chairman always refreshing hear colleagues across aisle who typically deny climate science forcefully suddenly get interested things like co2 emissions have discovered correctly forest fires actually cause co2 into atmosphere guess progress hope now will begin listen overwhelming majority climate scientists who are saying this fossil fuel energy bonanza theirs actually primary driver catastrophic climate change reason have record-breaking disasters one after another because this fossil fuel bonanza hope can build progress this awakening have begun hear least some climate science now was mentioned chairman believe erroneously forest treatments have gone down since passage legislation mentioned two congresses ago fact need little bit correcting there since passage these two laws forest service has been treating record number acres including record number prescribed fires california across country also know from 2002 forest service consistently increased acres treated nevertheless let's pick where trump administration left off chair 2.65 million acres were treated know biden administration was able treat 4.3 million acres lot more than trump administration numbers admittedly leveled off over last years because republican budget cuts but have still topped million acres year very different trajectory than what has been suggested chair yield minutes gentleman from virginia beyer beyer chairman rise opposition fix our forests act rise fight what could first successful attempt undermine endangered species act believe california people deserve our urgent support recover rebuild from tragic wildfires disappointed this was not productive discussion bipartisan discussion help address what need there are many excellent pieces legislation should looking for support including many are bipartisan like modernizing wildfire safety prevention act those bills provide much-needed funding deliver desperately needed support firefighters address needs frontline communities this bill does not instead regurgitates long-held logging industry priorities reshape environmental laws forest service land allow profit not science dictate forest management decisions co-chair endangered species act caucus particularly troubled this bill's rollback endangered species act enforcement overturning ninth circuit court appeals cottonwood decision this decision basically says when new science emerges develops endangered species must considered endangered species act protections way science goes both ways can both identify new dangers but can also identify successes reduce stresses threatened species industry has long tried include so-called cottonwood fix several pieces must-pass legislation most recently farm bill now see their response california wildfires their newest opportunity undermine cottonwood this industry wish list item would exempt federal land management agencies from reconsultation under endangered species act process ensures federal agencies land management plans incorporate best available science becomes available absolutely essential but this also rare occurrence doesn't happen very often when does important consider any student history science knows our shared knowledge continuously evolving through new inquiry discovery didn't incorporate new knowledge then would still stuck with geocentric model galaxy placing earth center universe then think about modern medical system modern medical community built off 19th century germ theory which has saved hundreds millions lives incorporating new scientific knowledge bedrock our modern society makes sense when new science emerges close our eyes put our hands over our ears deny what best science tells this antiscience esa poison pill dropped unconnected wildlife management yes need good-faith forest management efforts prevent wildfires but not environmental rollbacks allow for logging other ecologically damaging activities would worsen not reduce risk destructive wildfires need take real action mitigate risks effects ready work with all

today not today need tomorrow time 1330 regardless where when catastrophic wildfires occur offer grim lesson costs thoughtful prevention would have been far less than those inflicted merciless flames old adage ounce prevention worth pound cure never more true than when comes managing our forests spend billions dollars fighting fires every year our forests should income stream our federal government not cost people manage forests all over country actually produce great products into homes sustainable buildings become carbon sink because wood percent weight carbon this table was atmospheric carbon was stored this wood some point history still this wood instead burning these forests spewing more carbon into our atmosphere should looking innovative ways use our forests keep them healthy resilient forests provide clean air clean water wildlife habitat but don't when are burned ground these fires oftentimes are hot burn organic material out soil hard get trees grow back have seen this angora fire visited several years ago years after fire had been replanted six times trees still wouldn't grow because soil had been damaged these intense wildfires argument has been made these fires are result climate change case question still remains what are going about have unhealthy forests are way overstocked with way more trees per acre than have ever seen small trees are competing with other trees for light water nutrients get weakened die insects disease come this isn't just california all across our country know what question will fix our forests act will give opportunity what know needs done have talked many our federal land managers across country wanted commit their life working area make difference disheartening them have gone forestry school whatever

project like clearing dead overgrown brush can even start length time increases more than three years when nepa lawsuit filed those delays can deadly bipartisan fix our forests act would simplify

state local governments don't seem get policies produce these outcomes now have great chairman who prioritizing solutions here managing risks better this amendment which think chairman agrees with strikes prioritization carbon sequestration ecosystem services biochar demonstration projects this bill prioritizing projects based their impact carbon sequestration impact ecosystems rather than impact forest health forest fire reduction risk throwing more money problem while failing improve situation ground chairman think what all want focus today our priority chairman's priority focusing finding solution problems see today occurring our country most recent wildfires california have demonstrated continued prioritization other things expense risk reduction--that what are talking about here risk reduction not only property but lives are lost--creates deadly disasters kill americans destroy their property over over again underlying bill makes important changes improve how our forests are managed maximum extent possible not like westerman just some guy here who trying right thing because believes right thing guy congress who actually knows how this stuff great chairman leading this effort this amendment furthers this intent making sure are focused demonstration projects which maximize forest health resiliency let's remember chairman are trillion debt every 100 days another trillion dollars have really make sure resources are spending get fixing problem would like other things would sure like lot other things but there are needs there are wants chairman focused needs moreover this amendment ensures these projects are not hijacked those who would use them implement u.n.'s natural capital accounting block actual productive use land undermine one fundamental values america which personal property rights chairman certainly appreciate chairman westerman's support for this commonsense amendment improve this bill yield gentleman from arkansas westerman westerman chairman rise support representative perry's amendment which would remove certain references from section 301 bill wholeheartedly support section 301 bill which provides opportunity have new market for this overgrown material needs come off land into biochar biochar can thought soil amendment improves soil fertility allows more water nutrients stored soil almost seems like perfect thing have these western forests where have water issues overgrown forests can actually make product very beneficial whole system out there chairman appreciate gentleman's support support his amendment perry chairman reserve balance time huffman chairman rise opposition this amendment acting chair gentleman from california recognized for minutes huffman chairman were under impression this was essentially closed rule many our beneficial amendments were rejected out hand ruled out order but apparently there always room for amendment will make bill worse have great example right now co2 sequestration benefits potential ecosystem benefits biochar are couple most attractive possibilities for this program know chairman westerman believes because have talked about biochar has talked about possibilities this truth science biochar not settled have more work way studies establishing program carry out demonstration programs for development commercialization biochar could good opportunity better understand its role healthy forest explore some these interesting potential benefits now with this amendment have with ideological blinders because apparently merely mentioning words like co2 sequestration ecosystem benefits are triggering are going end part study are going put ideological blinders are going fire scientists are going burn books rename gulf mexico this just remarkably wrongheaded surprised disappointed chairman actually put good provision into his bill page h334 let make very clear democrats like part this bill are about beneficial aspects because this absurd ideological obsession where have deny all climate science not talk about environment just deeply disappointing chairman reserve balance time perry chairman let's not mislead anybody here have amendments this one think there another one coming very shortly from other side aisle which awesome want have these debates this not ideological maybe great maybe biochar demonstration needs happen question really does federal government need pay for valuable then private sector private industry should this work private industry should make this investment because are out money american people this government out money don't know how many times have tell everybody here chairman support amendment yield back balance time huffman chairman excuse for this amendment don't have money then amendment strike whole program don't simply single out parts are environmental have with climate solutions what happening with this amendment just same old ideological blinders chair again greatly

without need for timber sale unfortunately catastrophic wildfires continue ravage california western united states need some commonsense solutions balance sustainable forest management practices with

but apart from this also know need act address underlying intensity these extreme weather events fueled climate crisis apart from supporting amendment also urge colleagues continue work find commonsense solutions act this crisis impacting many american families thoughts continue with people who have loved ones their homes these horrific fires also thank brave first responders firefighters who have been battling these fires chairman again urge passage amendment reserve balance time time 1345 westerman chair claim time opposition amendment even though not opposed acting chair without objection gentleman from arkansas recognized for minutes there was objection westerman chair rise today support amendment offered representative carbajal which would enable forest service approve removal hazardous trees near power lines federal land without being required formal timber sale this would help address very serious wildfire threat downed hazard trees within utility rights-of-way remain one biggest ignition threats have sparked some most significant deadly fires country's history for example largest single wildfire california's state history dixie fire ignited when hazard tree fell onto electric lines similarly camp fire deadliest wildfire california's history was caused faulty electrical transmission line camp fire killed people destroyed communities paradise concow recent years catastrophic fires maui texas have also been linked downed utility lines early reports suggest this may have been cause eaton fire near pasadena altadena california mitigate these threats utility companies try maintain clear rights-of-way removing hazard trees within their utility corridors this done under special use permit however dispose felled timber utility companies are required through lengthy timber sale process this frequently leads wood waste stacking piles which further increases wildfire risk unnecessary burden preventing active management some highest risk areas our

distance himself from wildly unpopular project now week into donald trump's presidency has all gone out rightwing window under donald trump dawn golden age for project this should infuriate working people from one end america other here bloomberg news headline from yesterday trump's early actions mirror project plan once dismissed fact according bloomberg more than initial executive actions announced administration come directly directly--from project let repeat more than executive actions announced administration come directly from project project officially donald trump's policy playbook less than week into his term president trump has gone after medicare savings for drug costs cap out-of-pocket spending for medications where find those ideas well are right out playbook president trump also signed executive orders would eliminate good-paying jobs clean energy opened floodgates for big oil companies where find project playbook even though president trump said wanted leave reproductive care states his actions tell was not telling truth pushed policies barring doctors from sharing information with patients about healthcare including abortion pushing anti choice beliefs into doctor-patient relationship here united states across globe when donald trump threatens roll back cost savings for prescription drugs threatens jobs making life easier for big corporations more expensive for average people where these ideas come from these many many more come from 900 pages project matter how much donald trump tries convince people had nothing with project truth has now come out project trump agenda unfortunately seems very likely are going see more these awful proposals weeks come from project right into trump administration congressional record volume 171 number wednesday january senate pages s160-s161 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov cabinet nominations schumer president now hegseth hearing takeaway from yesterday's hearing pete hegseth very clear pete hegseth woefully unfit for job secretary defense for hegseth yesterday's hearing was exercise obfuscation when confronted about serious accusations against his character hegseth repeatedly dismissed them smear tactics but refused respond how these character issues impact his qualifications for job when asked being guilty sexual assault disqualifying for job secretary defense hegseth refused answer imagine any other american interviewing for any other job refused answer question clearly more information needed about hegseth's background but when democrats asked make hegseth's full fbi background documents available all members committee republican chair said why why republican chair insistent keeping relevant information about hegseth locked away from committee members perhaps reason for republican stonewalling more evidence revealed about hegseth more obvious will become woefully unfit for job for hegseth when there are serious allegations not answer them directly instead just call them smear tactics''--especially such important job like secretary defense where people's lives are line--is just totally unacceptable totally inadequate basically nominee for very important position just ducking most important questions faced now let say few things about why these hearings are important for our country our side all indications our republican colleagues seem perfectly comfortable with advancing hegseth through senate despite his lack qualifications many our colleagues have private doubts about nominees but publicly are still willing embrace them donald trump's hold senate republicans has become very powerful nevertheless democrats will continue push pressure scrutinize each nominee committee because important get them record americans need see many donald trump's nominees are simply unfit for jobs have been chosen for americans need hear these nominees answer for donald trump's harmful policies some these nominees are severely unqualified--and many them are--these hearings are essential for exposing even get confirmed end information must come out even get confirmed important have all these questions asked see what answers lack answers are time comes months from now some donald trump's cabinet members fail job these hearings will have served important warning for american people see why democrats are committed ensuring each nominee vetted thoroughly scrutinized during testimony one other point way why think hearings are important hearings are also opportunity show whose side each party are these nominees favor tax cuts for very wealthy people are favor keeping programs help working-class people keep prices down such making sure medicare can negotiate drug prices which brings down price for everybody where stand where stand hearings glaringly show donald trump his nominees are side very powerful democrats who are asking questions are side working people hearings wind through through more more witnesses will become clearer clearer american people who whose side important have record these nominees even get confirmed end see who are guard against dangers might occur with them office show who whose side now couple more today's nominees are very troubling one vought few nominees illustrate what stake for working-class families better than donald trump's pick for omb director russell vought this one most influential positions entire white house responsible for not only producing president's budget but also executing president's agenda across executive branch will candid vought's appointment omb director would nightmare scenario for working americans difficult imagine worse choice implement white house policy than chief architect project let repeat because our republican friends don't want talk about but same time are likely vote for someone who was chief architect project powerful position implement head omb cannot simply cannot proworker support nomination page s161 russell vought last time worked white house vought pushed radical budget proposals gutted social security medicare medicaid funding for public health during last default crisis vought was key advisor hard right republicans who pushed america brink disaster using debt ceiling blackmail cut trillions funding for healthcare for seniors for hungry kids when congress did not appropriate donald trump's border wall vought raided accounts pentagon treasury department pay for top all vought put america's national security risk illegally withholding foreign aid ukraine attempt help donald trump campaign trail call vought extremist would frankly give extremists bad name only people america who can happy about vought are richest rich who would make killing donald trump republicans hand them another trillion-dollar tax cut again just let repeat this man chief architect project republicans are running away from project now but same time are putting its chief architect one most powerful positions federal government which had broad range across just about every policy today's hearing with vought reminder american people donald trump does not intend keep his promises working people donald trump were serious about being proworker would not have turned godfather ultraright oversee white house policy chris wright tragic fires california are another warning climate crisis continues grow strength scientific community across world from u.n nasa even national security experts agree ignoring climate change dangerous donald trump's nominee for energy secretary truly alarming oil executive chris wright everything need know about who wright what will fight for can found following quote once gave interview wright said oil gas make world round wright amassed his wealth fracking oil executive course thinks oil gas are only things count world article from new york times this morning called him evangelist for fossil fuels what makes wright troubling however perfectly willing admit climate change happening while rejecting should anything about says calling climate change crisis pure fearmongering says real crisis not enough people are using hydrocarbons imagine what said not enough people are using hydrocarbons crisis world can believe even says roadblocks unrestrained fossil fuel development are outright immoral this man extremist when comes energy issues not even among conservative mainstream far over what shock this wealthy oil executive thinks solutions world's problems are produce more oil this who donald trump wants leading america's energy policy wright's nomination should alarm bell for every single american who has gotten job recently battery plants factories other good-paying clean jobs many these americans are red states trusted donald trump look after them but far donald trump's pick for energy secretary concerned thinks we're not midst energy transition his words tell workers rural america rebuilding batteries wind solar hope our republican colleagues will repeat those words employees their districts who have gotten good-paying jobs these new clean energy industries everyone knows still have lot work before reach our clean energy goals everybody knows not going easy question whether not donald trump's administration going protect clean energy jobs have created kill them put people out work for sake big oil wright's nomination suggests donald trump willing let all those good-paying clean energy jobs have created disappear republican colleagues when donald trump wright start cutting jobs

these promises say will fight for working people despite decades doing opposite proposing things would hurt them democrats will hold republicans feet fire ensure are accountable american people promises help working people sound nice but mean nothing without real results too many republicans promises like tax cuts for very wealthy will actually make things worse for working people coming weeks there will one early sign shows whether not republicans intend keep their promises fight for working people who support through nomination process these nominees are going faces new administration will responsible for applying its policies will effect ones responsible for following through day-to-day promises made campaign trail american people want know will president-elect's nominees follow through cutting costs for american people will return cutting sweet deals for mega corporations wealthiest people this country will president-elect's nominees actually make communities safer will protect bottom line special interests will help their corporate contractors cozy foreign entities oligarchs all while undermining our national security will spend time settling scores for president-elect trump will actually help keep america safer will president-elect's nominees keep their promises serve america are just going serve swamp remember what happened during first trump administration swamp wasn't drained much doubled tripled more even during last campaign donald trump promised oil executives huge tax breaks would opposite promises made people these are kinds things need know from president elect's nominees need fair but thorough give every nominee chance make their case while also subjecting them some tough scrutiny after all what any reasonable job application process demands whether are average person applying for job somebody being nominated for very important cabinet position what democrats intend what will different than what intend legislative side will repeat what said last week democrats are ready work with anyone regardless party make life better for working people let mention one example from last week january because what democratic senate president did 2,000 out-of-pocket cap democrats passed inflation reduction act went into effect thanks policy millions americans with medicare part will save thousands dollars each year prescription drugs republicans want strengthen policies like these help americans save millions more healthcare spending democrats are open working together but our promise republicans also comes with warning

going get coming years one will fight for working people one will fight for swamp over next days over dozen president-elect's nominees will testify committee make their case country these hearings very real way are opening salvo for holding trump administration accountable public today want talk little bit about how senate democrats will approach these hearings uphold our promise stand for america's working middle class these hearings will very first real opportunity see trump administration's view who will fight for--working people special interests our approach will this will use these hearings show contrast between donald trump's agenda helping special interests--especially very wealthy--and democrats agenda fight for working americans page s84 nominees should expect tough candid but fair questioning should come prepared honest about everything--their backgrounds their experiences their commitment increasing opportunity for all americans not just those top will also asked tough questions about where stand president-elect's stated policies things will hurt middle class such tariffs tax cuts for wealthy undermining policies lower drug prices president-elect's nominees demonstrate are qualified committed lowering costs increasing wages strengthening our security democrats will take very seriously but president-elect's nominees are going push policies make inflation worse put more money pockets special interests duck those important questions will put record about their views for all american people see why democrats have insisted regular order for president-elect's nominees thorough nominations process ensures american people know precisely who these nominees are who will fight for unfortunately troubling pattern emerged last week from some republican chairs who seem eager rush nominations process without fully getting all necessary documentation getting documents not trivial busy work these are financial disclosures ethics agreements fbi background investigations these nominees have something hide these documents could show important don't rush hearings without examining record first more senate republicans try rush process without proper documentation more americans will ask themselves what are republicans their nominees trying hide how can americans trust for example donald trump's cabinet will free from conflicts interests republicans hold hearings before anyone getting chance review financial disclosures how can americans trust these nominees will serve public interest don't first examine all their ethics agreements how can americans trust senate republicans will what best for american people are more focused keeping donald trump happy than examining every nominee carefully these nominees will push policies make americans lives worse americans deserve know can determine with complete thorough exhaustive nomination process hegseth tomorrow's hearing with pete hegseth good example why thorough tough nominations process important hegseth donald trump's pick secretary defense arguably most important position entire cabinet confirmed hegseth would oversee workforce over million people handle issues life death regular basis his job will keep our troops safe keep our country safe there any cabinet position ought have steady drama-free individual certainly secretary defense unfortunately hegseth's background deeply troubling put generously all have read reports about his radical views his alleged excessive drinking allegations about sexual assault his failures financial stewardship multiple organizations these are such serious allegations for such important job why would armed services committee wish rush through these hearings particularly when documents are not available all members committee including fbi background check hegseth will have opportunity answer questions about these allegations about his record well his views can expect his hearing tough but respectful candid but fair stakes during tomorrow's hearing will very high--not just for nominee but for entire country not hard imagine emergency situation where secretary defense has make quick steady decisions about our military someone with pete hegseth's alleged history really kind person want helm very very important situation--dangerous situation--like really best interest americans safety something senators should ask themselves during tomorrow's hearing course should ask hegseth questions about when comes job like secretary defense there can zero question--zero--that nominee for job unfortunately hegseth's record leaves too many unanswered questions let's hope get real answers real documentation before anyone votes for hegseth for secretary defense laken riley act president laken

today are pertinent what taking place our world are hearing about trump effect actually bringing forward deal with israel hamas hostages because remarks today are centered unrwa u.n relief works agency for palestine refugees now this has been one biggest obstacles peace middle east world unrwa presents itself aid group for palestinians but reality this agency--this u.n agency has been recipient 7.1 billion u.s taxpayer dollars--is nothing more than terror group works undermine israel's security safety have known this for years but aftermath hamas barbaric october attack jewish state have learned much more about unrwa's terror ties early last year wall street journal reported percent unrwa's staff have ties islamist militant groups among them took part october assault left 1,200 israelis dead hundreds more captivity after reports emerged unrwa teacher held israeli hostage his attic pressed agency investigate employee instead taking action group dismissed this request this claim unsubstantiated called israeli journalist who reported news immediately delete post also know unrwa has indoctrinated palestinian children with schools glorify terrorism promote violent hatred jews allowed hamas store weapons their buildings provided support aid terror group now new report from watch top watchdog for holding u.n accountable shows unrwa works with hamas well palestinian islamic jihad highest level agency quote report this secret relationship allows terrorist organizations significantly influence policies practices agency with 30,000 employees 1.5 billion annual budget funded primarily western states evidence overwhelming 2017 unrwa's then-commissioner general met with leaders hamas palestinian islamic jihad strengthen--in his words--``a spirit partnership protect agency's credibility however commissioner general urged terror leaders ensure discussions not made public course open collaboration with u.s.-designated terror groups could jeopardize millions receives from western countries every year tried cover could keep getting these millions billions dollars--as said u.s taxpayers 7.1 billion has gone into this group years since unrwa leaders have repeatedly pledged support for palestinian terrorists same year agency's lebanon director told terror leaders unrwa hoped have strong partnership with them year later their program director lebanon met with hamas official discuss ongoing cooperation coordination also 2018 former unrwa official appeared rally alongside hamas terror leaders who urged support for unrwa until return palestine''--meaning end israel jewish state unrwa official course thanked terrorist for their understanding 2021 former deputy commissioner general unrwa met with sinwar--now hamas leader who later planned october attack--after one her employees admitted israel's strikes hamas are very precise response deputy commissioner general removed employee from his position thanked sinwar for his positivity desire continue cooperation facilitating agency's work gaza strip see there pattern here participation between unrwa between hamas palestinian islamic jihad this just sample page s163 high-level meetings between leaders unrwa these groups list could what this report makes very clear unrwa's support for terror groups not something happens agency's fringes instead supporting enabling terrorism against israel unrwa's main purpose want say again unrwa's support for these terrorist groups not just fringes with their leadership are supporting enabling terrorism against israel need realize this this why president trump canceled u.s funding agency during his first administration why president biden's decision 2021 restore funding--over 730 million year was huge mistake after october attack led charge introducing legislation defund unrwa march last year president biden finally signed into law 1-year ban funding with all know about unrwa though need make this ban permanent

communities this something not just republicans senate are talking about this something american people spoke loudly clearly about during last election when elected president trump republican senate republican house there not single member who republican this body house clearly president trump who didn't talk about border security safer communities throughout entire election every single poll showed this was one priority issues every single american was thinking about gallup poll last year found more than three-quarters americans support increasing number border patrol agents two-thirds americans want president homeland security secretary temporarily halt all asylum requests when border overwhelmed third majority americans support expanding border wall construction people want secure community floor this week--we started last week are still debating this week--is what what called laken riley act some americans are familiar with laken riley's story some are not laken riley was college student georgia who was brutally murdered venezuelan who came into united states illegally was detained border but then released traveled around country wherever wanted under parole system was given him border 2022 committed crime was arrested for crime then was released committed another crime--shoplifting was arrested for crime was then released third crime far know--there might have been many more but third crime far know was his murder laken riley should have never been united states should have never been paroled border should have been detained then deported but wasn't was paroled into united states when committed crime united states should have been deported but was not was released when committed second crime united states should have been deported but wasn't was released--before ever got murder laken riley act pretty simple says someone here illegally commit crime united states stealing americans stuff like did deported don't think radical concept able say americans don't want someone come into country illegally take their stuff why this even challenge able pass this have idea this passed house last session but senate never took even discuss any great million oklahomans state say what think about someone illegally coming into country stealing people's stuff think should still able stay don't think would find anybody million oklahomans who would say with someone illegally coming into country stealing people's stuff say can ahead stay all this bill does says someone comes into this country illegally starts stealing stuff are detained are held are not just allowed released able drift around country steal other things commit murder later come into our country illegally start stealing things are detained will through rest legal process doesn't mean are automatically deported very next day still have legal challenge there can have their legal challenge but are not going just wander around country why believe this laken riley act important because never ever ever ever want have another american who murdered someone illegally present here especially someone who had already committed multiple crimes before ever got murder let's have debate willing able talk any one democratic republican colleagues who has question about this but base this why would let someone who already illegally present country who already know has committed additional crimes just continue walk our streets just commit more crimes why would not detain those individuals monday president trump will inaugurated looking forward working with him seeing even what happens day one able secure border this something american people want want border secure want communities are secure want just basic commonsense things done like someone breaks into our country then steals stuff are actually detained rather than just released again let's least basics can while continue able work toward big projects still need done multiple colleagues will coming moments

valedictory tour now here one accomplishment won't mention crisis our southern border which has spread chaos across our country flooded our communities with fentanyl cost innocent american lives now correct call this one president biden's accomplishments intentionally reversed trump administration's border policies soon reached oval office was design--by design--that millions migrants who illegally crossed our southern border were released into our country this self-inflicted disaster will major part president biden's ignominious legacy part why americans chose return president trump office november when american people voted for republican president republican congress were voting restore rule law border were demanding their government fulfill its constitutionally delegated duty provide for their national security were demanding their government were arguing correctly not discrimination for nation demand those who seek call home legally american people want return commonsense

migrants must number border patrol immigration customs enforcement officers must increased barriers illegal entry must expanded enlarged republicans are working legislation which will help accomplish all these things improve security our border just like american people expect will too little too late for family laken riley though course should still with today man who murdered her last february should have never set foot america her death was preventable her killer entered this country illegally was quickly paroled then was sent taxpayer expense new york where was arrested released was end story would still outrage indictment failed biden administration but from there went georgia see--all courtesy taxpayers--where was arrested freed again before brutally murdering laken riley weakening border enforcement incentivizing criminals with specious asylum claims cross our border failing detain deport these very same people for crimes committed far away from it--these were policies led laken's death this cannot happen again can't happen again another american their family why need pass laken riley act won't singlehandedly end crisis our southern border not its objective but important first step broader mission have been assigned american people homeland security must detain migrants charged with crimes--here again common sense--crimes like shoplifting one crimes for which laken's killer was arrested bill are currently debating laken riley act requires this meet objectives american people relates border security see enforcing immigration law national security

our law enforcement started confiscating twice much methamphetamine times much fentanyl times much cocaine because our open southern border cartels taking advantage just like all around country our young people paid price well taryn lee griffith was young mom two who took pill was laced with fentanyl died because single largest killer americans fentanyl overdose all facilitated president biden's open border policies along our southern border jose ibarra was different kind problem jose ibarra was venezuelan national who crossed our border illegally texas area asked for asylum his wife said just wanted better job but regardless biden administration released him into this country was bused new york city there was arrested for acting manner endanger child under age however new york city sanctuary city was not detained deported ought have been was released made his way georgia once again was arrested this time for shoplifting but once again was not detained deported immigration customs enforcement because was not went brutally murder laken riley this page s166 tragedy could have been avoided president biden had been protecting our southern border illegal immigrants were being detained deported people who break laws our country need held accountable what laken riley act does requires immigration customs enforcement detain people who are breaking our laws when people come here illegally are breaking our laws need held accountable with laken riley act are committing theft burglary shoplifting will detained tragedies like laken riley can avoided this just common sense need enforce our laws common sense need protect our borders thank goodness starting few days will have president who understands safety american people priority president trump will secure our borders election results were overwhelming president trump has mandate secure our borders senate republicans will stand help him just laken riley act our first step able help him call upon colleagues from other side aisle continue support this bill have done previous votes let's get this bill passed let's make sure other families don't have live through tragedy laken riley's family had live through yield floor presiding officer senator from iowa ernst president our nation this body american people are all too familiar with stories like laken riley's year-old nursing student beaten death illegal immigrant one who was already police custody new york city before being let unfortunately after years biden's open border this heartbreaking story has become too commonplace hardly day goes without hearing another american who has fallen victim crimes perpetrated illegal immigrants biden administration let flood into our country worse too many times illegal immigrant arrested for violent crime posts bail never heard from again escaping through loopholes law this crisis only continues while these tragedies should have never happened first place colleagues are taking action ensure never happen again legislation sarah's law conjunction with laken riley act will close these loopholes our laws longer prioritize illegal immigrants over our own citizens working secure border protect americans not new fight for but became personal nearly years ago january 31--so end this month--marks years since iowans michelle root scott root whom know personally woke every parent's worst nightmare their daughter sarah was killed drunk driver who was illegal immigrant sarah--and beautiful young woman was years old was from council bluffs had just graduated from bellevue university nebraska with 4.0 gpa had her bachelor's degree criminal investigations was headed home after celebrating this really important milestone with her family her friends sarah had her entire life ahead her but instead illegal immigrant edwin mejia who was drunk driving with blood alcohol level three times over legal limit struck killed her one would think sarah's killer would clearly meet immigration customs enforcement's enforcement priorities but citing obama administration's november 2014 memo ice declined take custody mejia despite his repeated driving offenses history skipping court dates before root family could even lay sarah rest her murderer posted bond was released never seen again rub salt wound biden administration removed mejia from ice's most wanted list since then have warned repeatedly against dangers letting illegal immigrants--who have already broken our laws--roam country continue their lawlessness have continually called this body step protect innocent americans from criminals who are here our country illegally pass bill sarah's law loophole law means sarah's killer escaped justice but today can something ensure other family has through pain grief sarah's parents scott michelle still feel from their heartbreaking day bill named sarah's honor would close alarming loophole let sarah's killer free would simply require ice detain illegal immigrants charged with killing seriously injuring another person not disappear before facing justice common sense folks parent should have endure pain losing child like root family did but unfortunately riley family experiencing this same heartbreak sarah's laken's deaths are both tragic unfortunately are doomed repeated don't close loopholes law those who come here illegally harm our citizens should without question detained face justice again folks this common sense can longer prioritize illegal immigrants over public safety must pass laken riley act sarah's law send this message loud clear for sarah's family for laken's family for countless american families this action would protect yield floor presiding officer senator from hawaii recognized trump administration schatz president after months swearing down were focused lowering price eggs price groceries price gas price insurance--that was what last election was about right was about inflation was about amount people were paying what last election was about interestingly very first thing donald trump republicans have decided cut taxes for billionaire corporations are going pay for ripping off working americans now might sound like political talking point sounds too convenient too absurd how can spend years pounding party power about how much people are getting hit pocketbook--and were were price eggs price utilities price gasoline--still hawaii around 4.59 gallon people are still paying too much yet first order business not anything about not anything about cut taxes for wealthiest international corporations human history here today with senate democratic colleagues want make sort broader point democrats struggle through learn about argue about what went wrong over last years politically one things did not well enough stay same theme this place gets crazy especially crazy with donald trump president remember distracting even best circumstances people fly home then arrive monday there 5:30 vote oftentimes last vote thursday 1:45 talk about one thing from monday 5:30 until thursday 1:45 thing talk about often whatever floor whatever committee are going have have comment what are working but are also going talk about this rip-off tax bill because illustrates difference between parties going illustrate three dimensions all this talk about lowering costs was lie here with senate democratic colleagues including members senate finance committee led senator wyden democratic side who will forefront this particular fight are not here because are surprised republicans are going raise not lower costs because know was plan all along are not here because are shocked republicans want cut taxes for ultrawealthy like clockwork every time page s167 house senate presidency are here because nothing can distract from reality what about happen this will giveaway worst kind time when people can least afford how plan this little technical bear with house republicans are saying have pay for these tax cuts right reduce revenue government order pay for have find savings have either get new revenue kind off table for republicans don't like new revenue unless tariffs which americans pay--or have cut something last friday this document was released--and understand are watching this your phone even cspan kind small right get this document listed their so-called pay-fors other words how are going pay for these massive tax cuts for wealthiest individuals wealthiest privately held publicly held corporations human history here are just couple things are using so-called pay fors 700 billion cuts kicking millions people off medicaid 500 billion out medicare reducing access care for seniors everywhere more than 150 billion cuts affordable care act subsidies what does mean are aca get your healthcare through aca subsidy goes away your monthly insurance bill about skyrocket tens millions americans who pay for their health insurance through aca exchange receive subsidy are going have pay more what happens with money doesn't for roads doesn't for firehouses doesn't for public health goes this tax cut not exaggerating this not rhetorical flourish this not political talking point are literally cutting medicare medicaid possibly social security affordable care act are going take all these resources--these are their pay-fors--and shovel people can continue their private jet subsidies pay lower tax rate eliminate 15-percent minimum billion-dollar corporation tax before passed tax legislation when were charge there were lots wealthiest corporations international corporations history planet paid zero taxes--zero taxes what did both generate money but also because question basic fairness established minimum rate for these wealthy corporations want eliminate too why because this what because actually their governing philosophy know say campaign poetry govern prose not what happening here campaigned misleading people their abiding concern their main concern was gosh people are paying too much for dozen eggs don't mean diminish people were paying too much for dozen eggs but right now inflation 2.7 percent gas lot places across country below bucks people were paying too much people were rightly pissed off--by way democrats too for not recognizing how acute this problem was for lot american families get but don't know anybody who thinks solution people paying too much out pocket make them pay more out pocket there not single voter know--not single voter know--that have interacted with who says know what gosh wish highest corporate tax rate were just little bit lower gosh wish 15-percent minimum billion-dollar corporation tax were rescinded gosh wish people who are being subsidized can afford healthcare--i wish would eliminate gosh wish would use all money shovel back wealthiest people world are not going stop talking about this just had two hearings with sean duffy marco rubio know pam bondi was today lots very exciting interesting things are happening are going have comment are going have engage but every week are going talking about this rip-off every week every opportunity get are going talking about this because this difference between two political parties with want yield very good friend who really understands tax policy with whom have been working this with whom--we fought together aca fight many many years ago senator chris murphy from connecticut yield floor murphy thank very much senator just can't believe are talking about something nobody wants right what this comes down priority for republicans extending likely expanding tax cut benefits wealthiest percent percent this country rate dwarfs--dwarfs--the help for anyone else tax cut are talking about extending gives tax cut top percent earners this country isn't times bigger than working families bottom income scale not 100 times bigger not 500 times bigger taxpayers top percent will get tax cut 852 times larger than working families bottom income threshold--852 times bigger what have seen coming out pandemic while broad middle country has been struggling wealthy have gotten richer richer richer have more billionaires than ever before this country folks don't rely salaries can just plow their income their earnings into capital markets have reaped huge huge rewards very very wealthy this country right now this moment time don't need any more help yet average family top percent bracket going get tax cut average 70,000 well make 30,000 this country are going get about 100 back your pocket course theory just layer tax cuts for corporations for billionaires millionaires money will eventually trickle down everybody else right lie not true fraud has never been true has been perpetuated american public because great way rationalize giving bulk tax cuts very very wealthy idea somehow will make down rest any main street this country into any subdivision your state--you won't find many your constituents who make 50,000 100,000 even 200,000 who have had much trickle down them senator schatz's point years ago when this tax cut was first put into place was egregious not because balance only but also because whole thing was borrowed all money was just put american credit card--a credit card comes due ends getting paid middle-class families one way other this time around guess good news are talking about paying for not borrowing give huge tax cut corporations billionaires millionaires instead are talking about immediately taking money out pockets working families seniors poor people instead borrowing money having bill come due for middle-class families later this new tax cut for billionaires corporations going financed immediate cut services benefits some most vulnerable people this country end last year means passing continuing resolution there was deal apparently cut--this reported press--in which there was promise made finance this tax cut with trillion cuts medicaid medicare medicaid--poor kids poor families medicare--seniors this country now trillion hard number get your head wrapped around but there way enact trillion--$2 trillion t''--worth cuts medicare medicaid without hundreds thousands people senior citizens poor kids losing access care are literally--this not hyperbole--$2 trillion worth cuts means nursing homes shut down people are put out streets means poor kids don't get access mental health services page s168 what happened years ago was cruel--a tax cut put american public's credit card percent benefits going very very richest none trickling down this version republicans are talking about passing matter weeks even more cruel because same balance benefit going very very wealthy--president-elect trump's friends who pay get out mar-a-lago--but financed immediately cuts are going devastating for people this country who get every day relying programs like medicare medicaid agree with friend from hawaii have down floor talking about this every single day folks thought was inevitability years ago when republicans made priority steal health insurance from million americans skin our teeth were able save health insurance for million americans maybe raise enough fuss about this massive transfer wealth from middle class poor very very wealthy can stop this egregious policy well yield floor presiding officer senator from oregon merkley president let's talk about trump's betrayal middle-class america 2017 many warned trump's tax giveaway was disaster for working families was giveaway billionaires was giveaway powerful corporations stole from america's treasury increasing debt this country gild richest americans wanted platinum treatment wanted more money than anybody else has ever imagined got from trump draining american treasury well failed america's working families there nothing about giving several hundred thousand dollars richest americans--that each one them--that helped single working american these policies are coming end but now trump coming along says campaigned working americans but want raid programs for them raid treasury enrich them again didn't give them enough first time around rich are not rich enough campaigned for working families but going betray them with tax cuts tax giveaways tax raid programs treasury for richest americans trump betrayal are facing right now cbo says extending trump tax cuts would blow 4.6 trillion hole federal budget over next years colleague just pointed out republicans are saying might decrease size hole raiding healthcare for americans what evil twisted plot what assault working families across our nation 4.6 trillion--no did not say for million for billion are talking trillion 4.6 trillion--should basic services for all americans reduce our deficit instead going into pockets very few whom are for are for very richest percent 0.1 percent americans who have much money don't know what with are for working families because this trump budget betrayal working families are for working families invest healthcare don't raid invest housing don't raid housing programs invest education don't raid education programs those are foundations those are good-paying jobs those are four foundations for families thrive work hourly job make less than 34,000 year--which case for million american taxpayers--you would get back 130 year--$2.50 roughly two half dollars all right right now less than cup coffee enjoy every week because what trump cares about for those families who are working bottom ladder trying move instead helping move wants take programs away from them give them these folks who are going get 280,000 per person tax break very top look how skewed this working families left get nothing richest right get everything what are looking little tiny 130--just little change cost drugs your rent your groceries wipes out two thousand times help for richest compared those who are struggling twisted warped trump betrayal working families let's stand for working families let's stand for healthcare housing education foundation for every family move ladder because what means care about every american family whether are party elite rich like trump betrayal presents presiding officer senator from virginia recognized kaine president join colleagues same topic talk about forthcoming debate will have about tax policies this chamber since coming congress--really before when was mayor governor--i advocated for smart simple pro-growth pro family tax reform taxes should fair should consistent should predictable should generate revenue america needs fund social security medicare education roads national security other critical investments matter our constituents repeat what some colleagues said 2017 during first trump administration after failed effort take health insurance away from more than million people deprive all americans being protected from discrimination insurance companies had preexisting conditions--and thank goodness reconciliation effort failed when three republicans joined democrats block effort trump administration colleagues turned idea tax reform democrats were very willing work deficit-neutral pro-growth tax reform but instead republicans chose don't want have committee process don't want include democrats want write bill will write bill will pass partisan tax cuts will dramatically expand deficit this time--and know colleagues remember this--economists were saying america's corporate tax rate percent was high compared global averages there was some suggestion what should lower corporate tax rate put more tune with what other nations were charging there little bit apples oranges difficulty doing because other nations use vat tax don't use most economists said wanted make our corporate tax rate equivalent other nations should try lower corporate tax rate from percent like percent many businesses virginia were coming saying have more competitive have have corporate tax rate matches more with global norms cut global tax rate percent instead even though companies were only asking for reduction our republican colleagues plummeted slashed corporate tax rate not percent not percent but percent didn't even pay for it--didn't even pay for senator murphy said just racked higher deficits there were few individual tax cuts this bill look bill from 2017 was mostly corporate tax cuts there were few pie chart individual tax cuts but were heavily tilted toward wealthy colleagues have described analysis time showed households top percent would get average tax cut 60,000 while households bottom percent averaged only 500 each bill also left out our nation's poorest children nearly million children were left out full value child tax credit because was not made refundable democrats demonstrated american rescue plan when expand child tax credit allow refundable could lead revolutionary drop child poverty when was effect but republicans took different route top these inequities bill was too heavily weighted toward corporations too light toward individuals with individuals too heavily weighted toward wealthy page s169 rather than lower middle-income people republican bill 2017 did another thing was entirely unjustified bill made corporate tax cuts permanent individual tax cuts temporary big permanent corporate tax cuts tiny temporary heavily skewed individual tax cuts during debate offered simple amendment virtually all democratic colleagues voted for said hey look let's ahead reduce corporate tax rate but let's not reduce percent reduce percent which big reduction can make these individual tax cuts for everyday people permanent least individual tax cuts everyday people would permanent like corporate tax cuts all republican colleagues opposed senate was majority republican were stuck with bad bill brings today republicans are debating how ram another 4.6 trillion tax cut through senate will remind colleagues when senate republicans did this 2017 were really proud because thought would help them 2018 midterms think was heavily driven electoral strategy what found after about days talking about american public was mad these tax cuts went wealthy rather than everyday people dropped campaign issue talk about other things still badly those midterms proposed extensions are going tilt toward wealthy colleagues indicated but get this deficit effects are likely felt some these distributional effects president trump proposing why not mitigate those jacking tariffs are going tax cuts benefit wealthy but are also going tariffs whom will tariffs impact president-elect trump often says tariffs won't affect americans will hurt china mexico but once election was over acknowledged can't guarantee american families won't affected costs tariffs going guarantee this president trump moves forward with broad-based universal tariffs are not defeated this body american families will suffer american families will pay cost know because have seen before study after study shows american consumers bore brunt trump's first trade war this time will even more projections suggest tariffs will impact american families tune either between 2,500 4,000 per american household additional costs 2,500 compared this tiny little tax benefit everyday americans will experience talk about salt wound are going tax bill for wealthiest when don't need not much for everyday people who need but put shoulders those same people tariffs are going increase cost goods imagine coming out covid other things having this kind burden put your shoulders there better path let give example democrats are going work with republicans tax reform will fair just last year saw bipartisan negotiations house how those negotiations can lead more balanced more smart better for deficit bipartisan priorities our colleague senator wyden was able reach deal with house chair jason smith bipartisan tax package would have lifted children out poverty--the child tax credit--that would have incentivized investment into research development good for companies who then innovate good for jobs also third piece this tax bill was bipartisan would have expanded our ability build affordable housing was fully paid for this bill got 357 votes house can't get for mother's day resolution house representatives but then died here senate because republicans didn't want take bill because wanted wait bill would benefit wealthiest urge colleagues made mistake before 2017 going down path busted deficit made american voters really mad don't down path again work with find tax bill will appropriately prioritize needs everyday american citizens small businesses yield floor booker senator kaine would yield for question kaine would yield for question from colleague from new jersey booker was stunning thing whom are for are working for americans are for american families are for wealthiest wealthy watched this slow motion this disaster for our country economically when was getting lobbied corporations same way said said are not globally competitive are not globally competitive everybody here all 100 want american businesses yes think should have--my opinion was yes let's make our tax rate globally competitive get rid some these crazy corporate tax loopholes people use many companies pay zero taxes could have had bipartisan conversation could have reflected our values lowered overall corporate tax rate found way get rid loopholes corporations don't find way exempt themselves from taxes when average police officer paying higher taxes than some biggest corporations watched during time--this was years ago--and began say let's make sure this tax plan benefits working americans because when invest middle-class americans working-class americans proven way grow economy other than this fallacy trickle-down stunning thing for me--and this where want to--i think was one most powerful points heard was when people were coming saying percent percent percent biggest corporations were saying publicly was reading newspaper lowest thing saw corporations asking for was percent what were those conversations like when were talking our colleagues other side how did end percent then not even support amendment bring back what corporate leaders were asking for benefit working-class people how could amendment not have passed presiding officer senator reminded question did refer chair booker forgive especially with who chair afraid direct question chair person here kaine president will just direct answer going reveal naivete because corporate sector virginia--and companies were like everybody's companies--were saying hey drop percent rate may have had one said but were basically saying are going equivalent other nations when bill was put table--and remember got with handwritten interlineations late evening when didn't even have ability even decipher what some handwritten interlineations were but realized had dropped percent almost thought was typo was one these handwritten things thought was typo because companies were only asking for percent then looked further this massive bill realized all individual tax cuts were tiny temporary expiring rather than being big permanent went colleagues said have got great idea for can take all these individual tax cuts shave off some ones most wealthy can make them permanent still what corporations had wanted having corporate tax rate equivalent other nations thought was being helpful had solution math problem thought were going like instead what said has got percent these individuals are going weighted wealthy are going temporary booker would senator yield for one last question then will page s170 yield senator lujan for his presentation kaine would glad yield booker senator came floor--or chair came floor listen good-faith arguments colleagues about trump tax cut heard them say would pay for themselves this was mantra heard over over again will pay for itself will pay for itself but independent folks like federal reserve board joint committee taxation found their corporate tax cuts did not pay for themselves but drove our government into multitrillion-dollar more deficit benefits within this idea trickle-down economics--said same groups just mentioned--were percent workers didn't see dime overwhelmingly expanded corporate wealth wealth top percent significantly didn't inure benefit postal worker cop firefighter plumber teacher stunning sat here listened folks but challenge because have been sort pragmatic moderate guy for long time are seeing this coming around corner estimates are now their new tax plan are talking about could cause deficit expand again now over trillion have been around here longer than have when start running budget deficits know factually their last tax plan expanded deficit into trillions--and this one projected again benefit top percent again with very few benefits going working americans--what will mean for america's fiscal stability going out years from now years from now what kind pressures will create what kind calls have from republicans about how fix problem their tax plan has caused kaine hope can take this budget committee have some budget committee colleagues who are here floor senator whitehouse has been lead democrat budget committee for some time now helm another committee but senator merkley who spoke passionately couple minutes ago now lead democrat budget committee need take issue these tax cuts proposed explore what long-term consequences will consequence will bust deficit consequence will put dollars hands those who don't need them take dollars out hands those who when combine with tariff effect but consequence will also significant national debt senator murphy said during his comments national debt gets financed gets financed ways ends coming back who pays for everyday folks will have compounding effect everyday folks where will not get tax relief may see their taxes increase will see their prices with this tariff blitz then will end being saddled with consequences debt should take time this right should take time do--again use example what finance committee did last year r&d tax credit child tax credit low-income housing tax credit not bill was perfect not included everything might want include but example don't have jam this through with one party holding pen excluding other party can tax bill can get 357 votes house representatives something will paid for not increase deficit will help businesses innovate help children get good start life help people afford affordable housing right way will come with good plan hope will whitehouse will senator yield for one more question kaine will yield for another question whitehouse through chair senator mentioned budget committee hearings have had budget committee during which have discussed tax cuts their effect revenues their ability pay for themselves how many times have our republican colleagues been able produce witness who under oath would say these tax cuts would actually pay for themselves kaine precisely zero even though phrase will pay for themselves have paid for themselves was used all time but one would under oath say actually happened reminds great political maxim think was eugene mccarthy former senator who once said issues candidate one who says word issues most times just saying these cuts will pay for themselves not same its being true wasn't true 2017 tax cuts could never find any credible witness who would come testify effect with have other colleagues floor who are ready raring yield them presiding officer mrs blackburn senator from new mexico lujan madam president especially want start giving thanks our colleague from hawaii for asking come together have conversation with american people proud senator from state new mexico--from small rural community northern part state--and wanted come down floor

happening here washington has impact our individuals families back home quite often see many decisions being made here this bubble washington without any true regard understanding impact main street where all live come from what are talking about today what incoming president donald trump had passed previously when was president which this massive tax giveaway billionaires what american people don't know which know are talking about--and why are here--is tax cut for billionaires about expire many colleagues republican colleagues want extend entire bill expense middle-class families across country now nonpartisan congressional budget office says reauthorizing trump tax bill as-is would add 4.6 trillion our national debt would raise interest rates make more expensive for families buy home send their kids college start business based how much time colleagues across aisle have spent last years--as have sat presiding officer's seat listening colleagues have heard them say should talking about deficit doing something about would hope would want avoid adding trillions dollars regardless who white house even now unfortunately doesn't appear case instead colleagues now--my republican colleagues--have come with two options for selling this legislation american people again this legislation will mainly benefit very wealthy this country billionaires--legislation going add trillion deficit this how plan one option republican leadership senate has suggested because want extend policy currently exists should just ignore cost extending there shouldn't pay-for don't have worry about all sudden trillion increase deficit just doesn't exist now know all wish could forget about actual debt sometimes but not what american people sent here not what american people can tell every family across this country has live within their means manage their budget--my family grandparents parents everybody every individual should working together address this issue other option have heard from some colleagues across aisle reauthorize this trump tax bill have suggested pay-for which gut medicaid order pay for tax breaks again for wealthiest people can't stress this enough again tax breaks for very very wealthy--the top percent--on backs working families backs individuals our middle class just outrageous padding pockets top percent expense hard-working families unacceptable nobody should stand for urge republican colleagues leadership this body work bipartisan manner this find solutions will benefit all americans not just ceos their board members there way can come together make sure our middle class benefits our small businesses page s174 companies--by way are essential for middle class our labor force because need both--work together benefit really work identify pay-for how are not going add deficit can't stress this enough need come together build spending reductions from bipartisan fiscal responsibility act instead targeting americans healthcare let's ensure wealthiest pay their fair share protect middle class their children from exorbitant trillion-dollar bill republicans are currently going send them two options just not work but there option works will stress one more time need work together bipartisan way this should not partisan issue this should not done just through reconciliation without any input from democrats because end day our families are different our communities are different firefighters nevada are different than firefighters your state hard-working laborers state whether come from service industry somebody who washing dishes restaurant nevada are different than person washing dishes some colleagues states everybody benefits come together bipartisan way how this should work hopeful colleagues are willing yield floor presiding officer senator from texas cabinet nominations cornyn madam president yesterday came floor u.s senate talk about importance promptly confirming president trump's cabinet american people having voted for president trump having said are unhappy with direction country going entitled his team help him actually what said would during campaign well today would like reiterate message but particular want highlight some hypocrisy our democratic colleagues this important matter pertains our country's democratic processes know our colleagues are frequently warning ways republicans are allegedly undermining democracy but this like little boy who cried wolf cry wolf often enough people begin believe not really serious indeed shouldn't taken seriously case allegation republicans are somehow trying undermine democracy let give example back 2022 when republicans passed state laws included commonsense election integrity measures like voter democratic leader chuck schumer criticized these initiatives which were intended ensure integrity our elections would think would no-brainer everybody would want embrace measures would protect integrity our elections but claimed somehow there was attempt suppress people from voting well remember wasn't long ago when barbara jordan democrat from texas revered justly incredible leader for our state country along with james baker iii cochaired commission came out with voter one consensus recommendations but now democrats claim making sure people are who say are using same sorts things need order get airplane buy tobacco six-pack beer somehow undermines democracy just doesn't make any sense but here senator schumer senate floor said republicans across country are trying stop other side from voting tears apart rips apart very fabric our democracy can almost see him crying crocodile tears says well did rough check moment ago 152 million americans voted 2024 republicans were trying suppress vote are doing lousy job because are seeing historic numbers people lot whom have not made practice voting before showed ballot box this time because hated direction our country was going felt like this was our last chance perhaps save our country know well senator from new york used this argument advocate for changes senate filibuster rule--the requirement get votes close off debate--in order pass what called federal voting rights legislation well first all what would have done would have preempted states laws when came voting practices created single uniform standard here federal level which would have prevented some these commonsense measures like voter from taking place well president biden also expressed same sentiment pressed for filibuster changed advance so-called voting rights package saying package must passed defend our democracy well actually would have made easier cheat now ironically used same argument for democracy undermine senate filibuster which one bedrocks this institution but what have noticed issue can framed threat democracy democrats throw any other concerns out window hence sky falling more recently democrats brought this same question protecting democracy reason advance legislation addressing artificial intelligence well turns out artificial intelligence has been around for decades has recently captured popular imagination because technology has taken places never dreamed could well committee rules administration held hearing democratic leader said this left unchecked here goes again said left unchecked artificial intelligence]'s use our elections could erode our democracy from within from abroad damage unfortunately could irreversible pretty common scare tactic scare people enough well maybe are willing let things otherwise wouldn't upon calmer reflection went stress importance republicans democrats working together protect reinforce our democracy are for but here what said can think few issues should both--unite both parties faster than safeguarding our democracy will take all administration private sector congress working together protect our democracy ensure robust transparency safeguards ultimately keep vision our founders alive 21st century well taken face value sounds pretty good until start beginning look details about what says need order accomplish goal where see--begin see huge disconnect pursuit another agenda democrats have become party cried wolf--or excuse me--threat democracy more say less meaning actually holds for what worth agree administration private sector congress should work together protect rather than undermine democracy but have some different perspectives points view about how might laudable goal but not pursuit fairly cynical partisan policy agenda there very tangible way democrats can join with this this week can cooperate with president people elected commander chief united states confirming his cabinet how for protecting democracy opposite which stonewall president's cabinet nominees burn much time possible before are able get done not preserving protecting democracy undermining our democratic colleagues never seem opportunity say whatever subject threat democracy but here are today participating campaign stonewall president trump's nominees which would argue undermining democratic process denying elected president united states who not only electoral college vote but popular vote well--to deny him his team can actually get work january 20th doing what was elected just yesterday senator schumer democratic leader came page s175 floor air his grievances each president's nominees for cabinet argued many policies would implement would disastrous but fact matter american people have chosen did november when went polls gave president trump substantial majority even mandate for new direction country repudiated failed policies biden administration starting with what has been happening border which unmitigated disaster from public health public safety point view would indeed threat democracy our democrat colleagues chose ignore will voters deny president his cabinet delay for good reason prevent these nominees from going work implement policies american people elected president trump enact unfortunately this sort reflexive kind what our democratic colleagues have been amazed listen television hear in-person for last--however has been--hour democratic colleagues who came floor speak but didn't talk about pending business laken riley act this young woman was killed illegal immigrant who should not have been country asked pam bondi who nominee for attorney general this morning during her confirmation hearing said president biden harris had secured border think laken riley would still alive said yes together with many others who have been victimized illegal immigrants who come across border americans harm one way another not all them but when open border more million people with million them got-aways evading law enforcement don't know what are going get well take back know what are going get are going get some people who not intend come here for better way life come here rape pillage rob commit crimes well republicans are tired hearing excuse after excuse from our democrats some these hearings are being delayed due incomplete background checks but ask yourself who responsible for background checks well joe biden's fbi fbi owes american people work around clock 24/7 get these background checks done timely basis otherwise are literally undermining democratically elected president would urge our colleagues other side aisle heed their own words when comes confirming president trump's cabinet colleagues other side aisle like talk big talk about defending democracy but would like see them put these commitments into practice ending undemocratic obstructionist tactics are using deny this president his team yield floor suggest absence quorum presiding officer clerk will call roll bill clerk proceeded call roll sanders madam president ask unanimous consent order for quorum call rescinded presiding officer without objection ordered senator from vermont h-1b visa sanders madam president forward this new session congress would hope very much there will serious focus crises facing working families our country are wealthiest nation earth fact are wealthiest nation history world yet today have more income wealth inequality than have ever had sixty percent our people live paycheck paycheck life expectancy working people far below other wealthy countries eighty-five million americans are uninsured underinsured some 800,000 americans are homeless twenty-five percent seniors are trying survive 15,000 year less have highest rate childhood poverty almost any major nation earth further remain shamefully only wealthy country not guarantee healthcare all people human right meanwhile while working families struggle put food table pay their bills wealthiest people our country have never ever had good are now absurd situation grossly unjust situation where wealthiest people top own more wealth than bottom half american society some 170 million people people top have more wealth than 170 million bottom not what america supposed about truth there are number reasons why are living nation today where wealth billionaire class exploding while working class our country struggles keep their heads above water there are many causes why despite huge increase worker productivity real weekly wages for average american worker are less today than were years ago--real weekly wages are less than were years ago--and why during period there was trillion transfer wealth from bottom percent top percent now lot reasons why very rich are becoming richer working-class families are struggling have with disastrous trade policies which have resulted millions good paying jobs failure congress raise minimum wage living wage another reason why millions millions workers today are forced try survive starvation wages furthermore are seeing have seen aggressive often illegal union-busting activities part major employers all those reasons more are issues have deal with today want focus one more reason why working class this country struggling has with h-1b guest worker program elon musk wealthiest man world with net worth nearly 430 billion other multibillionaires high-tech industry claim h-1b federal guest worker program vital our economy because scarcity highly skilled engineers other technology workers united states other words what say are trying desperately find highly skilled american workers their jobs just can't find them just not there view musk other billionaires who are strongly supporting h-1b program are dead wrong american workers are there are just not looking for them view main function h-1b program not hire best brightest theory--we have bring best brightest help our companies function grow wealth america theory but truth reality what h-1b program replace good-paying american jobs with hundreds thousands lower paid guest workers from abroad who are often treated indentured servants cheaper hire guest workers more money multibillionaire owners large corporations make other words this program not only grossly unfair american workers many ways unfair foreign workers well according economic policy institute between 2022 top companies using h-1b program laid off 85,000 american workers while simultaneously bringing over 34,000 guest workers from abroad 2019 percent h-1b visas were awarded entry level junior guest workers who are paid between percent less than american workers similar occupations simply not true h-1b program focuses very rare highly skilled workers american companies cannot find eighty-five percent repeat h-1b visas were awarded entry level junior guest workers are paid percent less than american workers similar occupations let just give few examples how unfair h-1b program dallas h-1b software developers are making 44,000 less than american workers doing exact same job this information from u.s department labor page s176 houston h-1b accountants--i did not know honest with had scarcity accountants but may h-1b accountants are paid nearly 40,000 less than american accountants doing exact same work santa barbara h-1b workers who are hired computer system engineers make just 45,000 year does sound like kind salary would bring forth some extremely highly skilled people for jobs american workers cannot fill madam president tell why would corporation hire american computer systems engineer salary 110,000 year when 65,000 cheaper hire h-1b worker for same exact position basically what this whole debate about large corporations are paying foreign workers substantially lower salaries than are paying american workers madam president want know why multibillionaire owners high-tech companies love h-1b program much reason why are using this program substantially undercut wages american workers moreover there are estimates many percent all new information technology jobs america are being filled guest workers according census bureau data there are millions americans with advanced degrees science technology engineering math who are not currently employed those professions other words tell kids out get involved stem work become scientist become engineer become mathematician whatever then bring people from abroad fill jobs were educated adding insult injury half top h-1b employers are companies whose major function life outsource jobs known industry body shops other words same companies are involved with supplying american companies with cheap foreign labor home are same exact companies provide even cheaper labor corporations when move abroad are two sides same coin madam president there truly major shortage skilled tech workers this country elon musk others have argued why did tesla lay off over 7,500 american workers last year including many software developers engineers its factory austin while same time applying hire thousands h-1b guest workers these jobs are only going best brightest why has tesla employed h-1b guest workers associate accountants for little 58,000 year associate mechanical engineers for little 70,000 year associate material planners for little 80,000 year will admit not rocket scientist but mind those occupations don't sound like highly specialized jobs are primarily for top 0.1 percent musk claimed last month this program really supposed about importing workers with highly advanced degrees science technology why are h-1b guest workers being employed fashion models lawyers dog trainers massage therapists cooks english teachers one might think united states america could find english teachers not need bring people from abroad further does anyone really believe america not have enough lawyers need bring more attorneys from abroad time massive income wealth inequality need fundamental changes our economic policies need economy works for all not just few one small but very important way forward direction bring about major reforms h-1b program order benefit american workers why have filed amendment laken riley bill are debating this week will just hope very much leaders agree allowing amendment debated voted upon let very briefly describe what this amendment does terms reforming h-1b program first this amendment would double major h-1b fee corporations pay before can hire guest workers from abroad this provision would generate over 370 million revenue each year what would use revenue for well would used provide nearly 20,000 scholarships each every year for american students pursuing advanced degrees science technology engineering math other fields vital competitiveness our nation members this body truly believe need h-1b visas order compensate for shortage skilled american professionals this amendment will attract tens thousands america's best brightest young people into those fields second this amendment requires corporations substantially increase wages for jobs need before would allowed hire h-1b guest workers specifically this amendment would raise prevailing wage for h-1b program least median local wage other words h-1b program truly meant for best brightest should not used tool undercut wages highly skilled american workers what this amendment would prevent third this amendment would prohibit corporations from replacing laid-off american workers with h-1b guest workers from overseas corporations are engaged mass layoffs should not allowed replace american workers with guest workers finally this amendment would prevent corporations from treating h-1b guest workers for all intents purposes indentured servants under current law h-1b guest workers are often locked into lower paying jobs can have their visas taken away from them their corporate bosses complain about dangerous unfair illegal working conditions unacceptable has got change this amendment would make h-1b visas portable give guest workers ability easily change jobs musk ramaswamy others have argued need highly skilled well-educated workforce agree but answer not bring cheap labor from abroad through h-1b program answer hire qualified american workers first make certain have education system produces kind workforce our country needs for jobs future bottom line must never cheaper for corporation hire guest worker from overseas than american worker home what this amendment all about let's clear thirty years ago leaders corporate america political establishment both major parties editorial boards most influential papers our country told not worry about millions blue-collar manufacturing jobs would come result unfettered free-trade agreements like nafta permanent normal trade relations with china don't worry about those jobs reason told not worry job would more than offset many good-paying white-collar information technology jobs would created united states yes said blue-collar manufacturing jobs but not worry will create zillions good-paying white-collar information technology jobs personally was member congress time never believed helped lead effort against nafta pntr with china unfortunately many others who opposed those trade agreements were proven correct nafta pntr cost millions good-paying manufacturing jobs large corporations shut down here america fled china mexico other low-wage countries search cheap labor what about all those great high-tech jobs supposedly were going created well didn't quite happen either result h-1b guest worker program other guest worker programs major corporations are now importing hundreds thousands lower paid guest workers from abroad fill white-collar technology jobs are currently available other words heads billionaires wins tails american workers view can must change reality good place start page s177 would pass this amendment put american workers first multibillionaires big tech should not allowed hire guest workers fill entry-level mid-level information technology jobs those jobs should going american workers who have among other things constitutional right form unions collectively bargain for better wages benefits working conditions madam president will asking for rollcall vote this amendment hope very much can get floor view time has come for american people know which side their senators stand this issue order accomplish goal very much appreciated statement majority leader thune gave floor senate last november about need for more amendment votes senate here what majority leader said november with respect amendment process a]ll members senate--and not just members particular committee--should have voice final legislation through amendments floor members should assume amendment votes will norm will mean taking tough votes times but part our jobs would very much agree with majority leader thune truth past whether has been republican leaders democratic leaders one debates

have significant influence over important communications channel united states access americans data but congress must appropriately balance those risks with serious hardship imposed tiktok's 170 million american users unintended consequences nationwide tiktok ban with impending tiktok ban congress has gotten balance wrong most importantly proponents ban have repeatedly argued tiktok brainwashing americans but these claims are best just speculation worst are disguised effort target americans speech don't take from affidavit district columbia circuit senior intelligence officer stated government has information china coerced bytedance covertly manipulate content tiktok coming from our own government alone should make pause this circuit court are not lying circuit court don't have any information with regard accusation even worse rather than addressing china's supposed influence over key communications channel tiktok ban appears driving users alternative chinese applications which know even less about fact monday rednote--a china social media app--became most downloaded app apple app store outcome law's supporters were seeking thought about tiktok ban not only threatens shut down platform critical for 170 million americans but also million american businesses use tiktok use part their business all will shut down sunday days from now--just shut down--7 million businesses who use taking effect least parts america single worst period time moment when tiktok creators los angeles are using app share their stories find resources during tragic wildfires moment when new president set take office with different views ban--and president-elect trump asking for pause right now asked supreme court united states for pause--donald trump--a moment when supreme court still considering case hasn't even rendered decision yet moment when first official bid for tiktok was just submitted last week time for congress acknowledge rushed passage this law was mistake there were hearings senate there were witnesses senate one got hear anything about this ban because put into bill was going provide military aid for ukraine for israel--humanitarian aid--and just stuck tiktok ban into legislation over house representatives send over here never had hearing never had any consideration time for congress acknowledge rushed passage this law was mistake need more time let courts outside parties consider this issue need better job understanding importance tiktok community impact tiktok ban why introduced extend tiktok deadline act this bill does not repeal underlying act simply gives tiktok congress people here senate parties might want buy tiktok incoming trump administration--he himself page s178 asking for extension--and outside stakeholders additional time get this right need time need time figure this out court process still going for something started last april would never have been expected have occurred don't have any certainty outcome one way other this had happened september october november--out courts--we could have then deliberated before deadline sunday days from now but didn't happen way millions creators who have bravely shared their stories explained why tiktok important them hear listening encourage colleagues listen well give short reprieve tiktok's death sentence tiktok far too important let die like this sunday without having given extra time which needed--time for president-elect trump time for everyone think about what alternative pathway could letting tiktok die president ask unanimous consent senate proceed immediate consideration 103 introduced earlier today further bill considered read third time passed motion reconsider considered made laid upon table presiding officer there objection senator from arkansas cotton reserving right object which most certainly tiktok isn't just another social media platform tiktok chinese communist spy app addicts our kids harvests their data targets them with harmful manipulative content spreads communist propaganda congress recognized unique dangers tiktok when voted massive bipartisan basis last april give its chinese communist influenced parent company bytedance 270 days sell tiktok american buyer shut down america deadline sunday what more bytedance tiktok had plenty additional warning for years about possibility such action long before congress set this firm sunday deadline trump administration attempted shut down tiktok there was rush senator from massachusetts asserted didn't pull rug out from under tiktok didn't ban instead congress simply demanded app could longer owned controlled our nation's worst enemy communist china other words tiktok's owners had plenty time find buyer there were plenty willing buyers well instead tiktok whined lied complained sued lobbied how lobbied one notable lobbyist told was offered 100,000 month 100,000 month--to represent tiktok but refused because tiktok sewer vile anti-semitism good for him unfortunately can't say for army lawyers lobbyists who saddled behalf communist china know who are should ashamed themselves should know for one won't forget let crystal clear there will extensions concessions compromises for tiktok bytedance chinese communists had plenty time make deal fact legislation allows president grant 90-day extension sunday deadline though only negotiations have substantially advanced sale could likely close days neither true today expect president biden will not grant extension what president biden cannot under current law this congress--this republican congress--certainly won't changing law not over objection any case isn't telling bytedance says communist china blocked sale tiktok for these last months what exactly does tell exactly what said earlier tiktok chinese communist spy app consider one reason why bill passed with such huge bipartisan vote april namely backlash against tiktok for its deranged lobbying campaign against bill bill was being considered house committee tiktok sent push notifications its users demanding call into congress express opposition bill this wasn't case american citizens spontaneously rising exercise their first amendment rights but rather foreign power egging them meddling our politics influencing our legislative debates what happened thousands children--kids--called into congressional offices some threatening kill themselves assassinate members congress foreign adversary should have kind power over our politics our children imagine how chinese communists would use tiktok influence our political debates during say moment heightened tensions over taiwan let's examine little more closely just what tiktok does our country just last week renowned social psychologist jonathan haidt wrote tiktok harming children industrial scale china's version tiktok promotes math science learning basically telling chinese kids their homework eat their vegetables respect their elders--most especially chairman chinese dictator america contrast tiktok promotes violence obscenity eating disorders drug use even suicide internal company documents even revealed content promoting pedophilia has long flowed right past tiktok's supposed moderators without question tiktok's lethal algorithm has cost lives many american kids china also uses tiktok amplify its propaganda suppress information critical communist tyranny beijing compared other platforms tiktok suppresses content related china's genocide against uighur people tibet taiwan south china sea hong kong tiananmen square origins covid among other topics tiktok also meddles politics other countries amplifying divisive content for instance israel india course america don't forget tiktok harvests vast trove user data including name age email address phone number credit card number facial features voiceprints keystrokes photos videos viewing habits this data can make users susceptible manipulation even blackmail not only today but also years from now when users may have become influential persons military intelligence community business media other walks life are sometimes assured tiktok has taken security measures prevent chinese communists from accessing this data american citizens but according whistleblower testimony internal company materials these protections are about airtight screen door end coming for chinese communist-controlled tiktok perhaps sale can closed sunday though seriously doubt even sale would have pass legal review guarantee china retains residual influence company through its algorithm residual influence whatsoever but one way other communist china will longer exert this massive influence over our nation our kids will now yield senator ricketts presiding officer senator from nebraska ricketts reserving right object chinese communist party our chief foreign adversary world only external existential threat our nation threaten our freedom our prosperity our security our very way life when was governor nebraska was first governor ban tiktok state devices because threat posed why did well because jinping said wants replace world leader dictators tend say what are going try should take him seriously tiktok one ways trying trying undermine what around world chinese communist party wants replace tiktok one ways are trying influence our downfall page s179 many 150 million americans use tiktok fifty-two percent them say regularly get news through tiktok know ccp uses tiktok slant news this part their propaganda data shows for example esteemed colleague from arkansas referenced anti-semitism tiktok back look can see times posts pro-hamas pro-palestinian content times views despite fact overwhelmingly americans support israel--the polling shows it--and just one issues get involved with wouldn't allow any foreign adversary stations radio stations newspapers reach 150 million americans why are allowing our chief adversary world one seeks our downfall have kind access makes absolutely sense course chinese communist party has free rights america those belong american citizens need make sure take step against this last april did overwhelmingly bipartisan bicameral because this congress saw threat tiktok poses chinese communist party being able influence bytedance because have bytedance chinese company has whatever chinese communist party says their law have what chinese communist party says therefore push propaganda colleague from arkansas pointed out spy americans collect data americans saw bipartisan effort over 350 votes house pass this bill way same bipartisan support here senate passing law gathered much bipartisan bicameral support because recognized this was about keeping america americans safe bytedance needed divest tiktok could assured chinese communist party wasn't pushing its propaganda spying acted with conviction against threat course know from our classified briefings what threat for tiktok was this threat not something far off imagined have seen tiktok's interference elections elsewhere around world most recently romania european commission just opened investigation tiktok's failure limit election interference romania's election has caused all sorts disruption country india has banned tiktok for very same reason are seeing push chinese propaganda slants their news media same way see here america albania worried about romania banned tiktok passed law did not ban tiktok passed law said have have american owner like don't know radio stations stations newspapers senator from massachusetts would like give 270 day extension what going different what going different bytedance has had 270 days rather than making legitimate attempts find buyer--and way all recall news stories when this law was being discussed being passed there were number americans who said would interested buying them bytedance didn't anything rather than looking for american buyer decided hire army lobbyists lawyers try subvert will congress spent last 270 days trying avoid being sold colleague said chinese communist party will not let them sold itself should tell everything need know about this chinese communist party refusing bytedance sell tiktok american buyer know are using push their propaganda collect data don't want those algorithms coming america because then will exposed what this about this national security threat why took action last april have had these 270 days did nothing with them extend would mean nothing well except give chinese communist party another 270 days push their propaganda spy more americans finally today our foreign relations committee hearing had confirmation hearing for senator rubio who has been nominated for secretary state asked him his confirmation hearing earlier today why average americans nebraska should care about threat chinese communist party poses our way life had great response want read here said stay road we're right now less than ten years virtually everything matters life will depend whether china will allow have not folks this clear test whether america going get off road are willing change direction are willing say chinese communist party enough further not now are changing are getting away from bad practices past chinese communist party taking advantage let's send clear signal beijing america's national security going take priority let's stand strong let's remember passed this law for reason keep americans safe therefore object presiding officer objection heard senator from massachusetts markey president disappointed colleagues have objected this simple legislation recognize national security risk here but fearmongering about supposed anti-american content tiktok exact type government overreach has left tens millions americans furious hyperbolic statements made colleagues are especially concerning given intelligence community itself has acknowledged has information china covertly manipulating content tiktok--no information let say again circuit court appeals government was asked present evidence bytedance was covertly manipulating content tiktok for benefit chinese government intelligence community submitted affidavit saying government has information being manipulated are out here today--by way would change whole debate had information would having different debate there were proof were manipulating provided intelligence community would having different debate don't have any information sat same intelligence briefings colleagues did kept waiting hear information never heard don't think giving secrets say didn't hear any secrets didn't hear them because there weren't any made filing circuit court appeals have information have read reports news articles have tracked court case closely clear-eyed about risk but unlike many colleagues also clear-eyed about profound economic political social importance tiktok 170 million users million businesses united states understand how many creators depend tiktok find community share their story find resources ask again here simple 270 days can try find resolution this issue doesn't have draconian cutoff sunday afternoon this issue are confronted with this point don't have evidence being cited colleagues other side aisle doesn't exist may believe but don't have evidence present this body because intelligence community has not provided otherwise again saying would have very different debate this very important issue because supreme court just had hearing--it unbelievable months later--on constitutionality your ban think colleagues mine who spoke other side are saying well should have already sold page s180 well took court find out this law was constitutional have right have right supreme court have right have hearing have right make their case have right say unconstitutional hasn't been ruled yet hasn't been ruled because all asking for more time listen donald trump saying give more time all asking for will say well when friend cites suicides other incredible consequences social media our society agree with him 100 percent but not just tiktok instagram facebook company after company after company targeting 14-year-old girls with bulimia with anorexia with information making them even sicker sicker sicker why when bill was killed here december pass law which said parents can just say erase all information are gathering about daughter--and third congress row happened yes tiktok should stopped should facebook should instagram--so should all them but just don't raise tiktok context raise senate context law should have passed should have already been president's desk was bipartisan was bipartisan want talk about lobbyists want talk about stopping legislation agree with gentleman fundamental fact tiktok contributor this problem but part larger problem also want make point there imminent threat compromise this information are talking about here today because intelligence community does not fact have information say accurate agree with donald trump give more time allow for process play out allow for supreme court make decision allow for potential buyers step forth allow for users tiktok million businesses use for their own families allow for families fire zone l.a continue use build community run their small businesses not cut off sunday what have been asking senate regret objection has been raised colleagues but tell there going real harm hope can partner with president-elect trump try find resolution this issue with information right now not have take such action yield floor presiding officer senator from arkansas cotton want respond briefly few points from friend from massachusetts friend want make underlying statement first off for record because this notable day direct quotes from senator from massachusetts listen donald trump agree with donald trump underline record not sure are going see again for next years but more importantly this issue senator correct tiktok not alone causing harm for american kids agree with him other apps can result eating disorders depression mental illness voted for his legislation december had own online safety legislation difference tiktok influenced controlled chinese communist party this bill did not just address tiktok addressed all foreign adversary-owned apps raised question rednote well guess what tiktok users flood rednote are going face same challenge there because also controlled communist party second senator has made lot about some affidavit some intelligence community official some case don't know what referring know this have been intelligence committee for years chair now have heard testimony senior leaders tiktok poses great threat our national security our people's well-being but also know this third don't need intelligence tiktok's own internal documents reveal threat poses americans state attorneys general have brought lawsuits defend their people those lawsuits have produced documents showed chapter verse exactly what tiktok has done americans finally keep hearing only 270 days only 270 days 270 days what tiktok will say again because will not have been sold because chinese communists won't allow sold because not just another app not instagram facebook anything else chinese communist spy app yield floor presiding officer senator from nebraska ricketts just want briefly build upon colleague from arkansas two quick points one our colleague from massachusetts has called this tiktok ban inaccurate law was passed colleague pointed out was about foreign adversaries required tiktok sold american owner had been sold tiktok could continue operation understanding even forced close down because hasn't sold sunday sold future will able reestablish operations long american buyer not ban reason ban because tiktok chinese communist party chose make ban bytedance has not tried parallel-path this which was colleague from massachusetts point could have been trying sell same time were going through court had ready fact could have written document saying only going sell supreme court says have could have found buyer written contract way absolutely didn't have make this ban with regard colleague from massachusetts other point did offer proof point based upon data here united states about how tiktok pushes chinese communist party agenda push their propaganda this case was anti-semitism against israel promoting pro-hamas terrorist group posts--its posts--and then pro-palestinian posts versus israeli pro-israel ones gave data there but this exactly same kind pushing propaganda which has led presume india ban tiktok well because chinese communist party doing same thing them couple points this again don't think anything will different 270 days from now because chinese communist party will not allow tiktok sold because their algorithm would exposed with would just end saying china must deterred yield

s344-s345 from congressional record online through government publishing office www.gpo.gov cabinet nominations schumer well president yesterday republican senators voted advance one most erratic unqualified unfit cabinet nominees have ever seen modern times pete hegseth possibly just few hours away from becoming next secretary defense overseeing greatest military world has neither character experience judgment required job there one word should never describe secretary defense this important position erratic but one word describes hegseth best before vote today hope republican colleagues think carefully one last time about risks american people particularly men women our armed forces confirming somebody like hegseth hope republican colleagues understand danger entrusting our military someone whose background has not been fully vetted know much his past remains uninvestigated know hegseth refused meet with democrats armed services committee save for ranking member how can such important job afraid meet with democrats committee going have much tougher adversaries than places like china russia iran north korea how could avoid know new allegations keep coming up--as recently last night--compounding word erratic when describes his behavior this not way vet nominee such important position secretary defense when are one responsible for leading our armed page s345 forces erratic behavior isn't just character flaw could mean difference between entering avoiding military conflict between life death for our troops all want what best for our troops all know voting for secretary defense one most important votes are going take all year mystifies all people president trump could have nominated secretary defense picked someone flawed--as deeply flawed--as hegseth pete hegseth really best have lead greatest military world this man with history excessive drinking really guy want other end phone a.m crisis control nuclear codes this man with mile-long list allegations abusing degrading harassing women one want leading our men women into battle this man who failed manage finances veterans nonprofit groups who drove his organizations into debt point where could not even pay creditors person want charge pentagon's budget want this last point sink dod colossal organization workforce million people annual budget over 850 billion pete hegseth really person want overseeing organization complex dod man who couldn't even manage finances small nonprofit yet pick him unbelievable was pressured resign from these small nonprofits now supposed run department defense with its millions people under his jurisdiction billions billions dollars odds are not low would mismanage pentagon's budget mismanaged small organizations worst all his erratic behavior can rear its ugly head because know when people who have history erratic behavior into high pressure situations often makes them more not less erratic refuse believe pete hegseth best republicans can come with for secretary defense there are surely other individuals--plenty others--the president could nominate would conservative voices would disagree with their views but least would have admit are qualified can think some republican senators who would certainly make much stronger candidate than hegseth hope republican colleagues think carefully today about consequences this vote hope right thing recognize there are much much better choices for secretary defense than hegseth credibility senate--i think credibility republican majority--is line with today's vote well-being our troops stationed around world line with today's vote very security american people our kids families neighbors friends line with today's vote short should not cannot must not elevate someone erratic pete hegseth secretary defense can must--must--do better urge colleagues vote finally want turn briefly subject vought nominee more threatening antithetical needs working people than this godfather ultraright--russell

https://perma.cc/zwc5-g5sv 220 extending comment period would allow this increasingly urgent unaddressed threat continue unabated giving countries concern more time opportunities collect exploit government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data.\44 delay only increases this unusual extraordinary threat which gives countries concern cheap reliable way among other threatening activities track movements american military intelligence personnel overseas from their homes their children's schools hardened aircraft shelters within airbase where nuclear weapons are believed stored not only countries concern like china draw commercially collected data sources insiders from country's tech telecom firms banks perpetuate its surveillance apparatus also sell their access such data for other nefarious purposes can put americans risk.\46 see e.g mehrotra cameron supra note describing analysis billions location coordinates obtained from based data broker provides extraordinary insight into

supra note describing how surveillance data black market has developed china due part there being virtually legal checks government's ability physically digitally monitor its citizens which phone numbers hotel flights records location data are sold criminal markets department also believes extending comment period would not provide meaningful additional input would improve rule department has gone great lengths provide public with meaningful opportunities provide input every stage development this rule department took optional step releasing anprm provide public with additional formal opportunity comment addition public's formal opportunity comment nprm rule closely tracks nprm which had all its core components extensively previewed anprm public has had least days formally provide comments throughout this rulemaking comment period nprm was days public had additional days review nprm while was public inspection federal register before was formally published public had days comment anprm addition these formal opportunities comment documented anprm nprm part iii this preamble docket regulations.gov department also provided extensive informal opportunities for feedback those opportunities began with multiple informal engagements with hundreds stakeholders before release order anprm after release anprm nprm department undertook extensive large-group small-group one-on-one engagements with over 800 stakeholder invitees participants across over informal engagements explain rule provide feedback page 1642 described part this preamble many comments received nprm merely state preferences renew comments made anprm without providing specific information new analysis not engage with analysis nprm constructive refinements suggested commenters have become increasingly discrete addition many commenters have not specifically identified what additional changes analysis data would provide given additional time comment department thus believes opportunities for public comment input during this rulemaking process have appropriately balanced need for feedback ensure rule effectively addresses national security risks need move expeditiously given increasingly urgent national security risks discussion comments notice proposed rulemaking changes from proposed rule discussion part this preamble summarizes comments submitted response nprm responds those comments department does not discuss provisions rule commenters did not address substantively has implemented those provisions final rule without change from nprm unless department otherwise addresses parts rule this preamble department incorporates nprm's discussion rule into preamble,\47 including for example department's determination categories covered data transactions pose unacceptable risk national security,\48 department's interpretation information informational materials under ieepa,\49 department's analysis for proposed bulk thresholds.\50 86117-70 86121 86165-70 86156-65 many comments were constructive expressed strong support for goals order rule use exemptions careful targeted approach addressing national security foreign policy risks department's changes nprm response comments anprm these comments suggested justified additional specific refinements help clarify reinforce targeted nature order rule which are addressed with respect relevant subparts rule some commenters suggested clarifications changes were premised misunderstanding narrow view order this rule for example some comments were premised view national security foreign policy risks addressed order this rule are solely primarily about identifiability set sensitive personal data nprm explained anonymized data rarely ever truly anonymous especially when anonymized data one dataset can become identifiable when cross-referenced layered top another anonymized dataset.\51 addition department discussed detail nprm identifiability only one range concerns anonymized data itself can present national security risk can pattern-of-life data other insights harm national security from anonymized data itself such case precise geolocation data).\52 sets bulk u.s sensitive personal data may also used identify vulnerabilities within population case bulk human genomic data enhance military capabilities include facilitating development bioweapons additionally even smaller sets bulk u.s sensitive personal data can used make statistical inferences conclusions about much larger population sets usually sample size should not need not exceed percent population make inferences about entire population however even extremely small sample sizes may allow extrapolation inferences about much larger populations for example meta requires only source audience 1,000 customers which need only include 100 people from single country order extrapolate lookalike audience million individuals for targeted advertising other words countries concern may able glean valuable information about health financial well-being large number americans through smaller datasets bulk u.s sensitive personal data result department has not adopted these suggestions not account for broader range national security risks order this rule address 86126-27 similarly some comments were premised narrow view sole primary focus rule sale data discussed length order anprm nprm further described part iv.c this preamble sale data only one means which countries concerns are seeking access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data countries concern also leverage vendor employment investment agreements additional vectors try obtain access result department has not adopted suggestions extent not account for full range risk vectors order this rule addresses many comments failed provide specifics department would need justify changes rule these comments merely stated policy preferences made conclusory assertions without providing meaningful support analysis without addressing analysis anprm nprm for example some comments claimed rule would have particular impacts certain sectors activities but did not identify specific non-exempt covered data transactions with countries concern covered persons currently occur rule would prohibit restrict explain significance these transactions sector industry show why sensitive personal data those transactions was integral share with country concern covered person explain why would not feasible shift those transactions other countries persons over time other comments reflected misunderstandings about order proposed rule for example several comments stated with respect different provisions proposed rule apply category activity including list specifics unclear whether those lists are exhaustive exemplary there ambiguity however because sec 202.102(b already defines including mean including but not limited final rule addresses other mistaken assertions misunderstandings with respect each subpart part this preamble clarifies what rule does does not one commenter reiterated comments originally provided anprm suggest order's proposed rule's restrictions access sensitive personal data are inconsistent with international commitments united states specifically commenter calls department make greater effort explain how rule consistent with u.s commitment towards promotion trusted cross-border data flows nprm explained rule permits cross border data flows except with respect page 1643 commercial transactions pose unacceptable national security risks thus lack trust required for free flow data which rule prohibits restricts.\53 because commenter merely renews its prior comment anprm without any attempt address explanation nprm further explanation appears necessary 86121 department will continue assess risk posed countries concern covered persons accessing government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data including examining whether department needs expand final rule tackle connected data security concerns such data scraping illegitimate data access via provision services from entities linked state threat actors department retains right promulgate additional rules within scope order address risk two commenters reiterated suggestions department make various revisions borrow incorporate aspects international state privacy laws into this rule previously stated nprm department supports privacy measures national security measures complementary protections for americans sensitive personal data.\54 despite some overlap privacy protections national security measures generally focus different challenges associated with sensitive personal data general privacy protections focus addressing individual rights preventing individual harm such protecting rights individuals control use their own data reducing potential harm individuals minimizing collection data front end limiting permissible uses data back end national security measures contrast focus collective risks externalities may result from how individuals businesses choose sell use their data including lawful legitimate ways commenters suggestions raise new justifications department did not already consider nprm stage nor these suggestions address how why privacy protections would adequately address national security concerns such department should align definition with existing privacy laws response nprm some commenters suggested adding new exemption for transactions which u.s individual consents sale disclosure their data country concern covered person one commenter requested department exempt disclosures nonclinical research data where research subjects consented disclosure their data another commenter expressed concern about their data being sold within united states for commercial purposes without consent equitable benefit rule declines adopt consent exemption for same reasons provided nprm explained nprm such consent-based exemption would leave unaddressed threat national security allowing u.s individuals companies choose share government related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data with countries concern covered persons.\55 precisely those choices aggregate have helped create national security risk access countries concern covered persons purpose order rule address negative externality has been created individuals companies choices market first place would also inconsistent with other national security regulations leave market choices decide whether give american technology capital data country concern covered person export controls not allow u.s companies determine whether their sensitive technology can sent foreign adversary sanctions not allow u.s persons determine whether their capital material support can given terrorists other malicious actors likewise rule does not allow u.s individuals determine whether give countries concern covered persons access their sensitive personal data government-related data one reasons public not position assess make decisions about national security interests united states public typically does not have all information available make fully informed decision about national security interests united states department also declines adopt residual compensation requirement for domestic sales data order this rule not address purely domestic transactions between u.s persons--such collection maintenance processing use data u.s persons within united states--except extent such u.s persons are affirmatively publicly designated covered persons each subpart rule including any relevant comments received corresponding part nprm discussed below remaining sections this preamble general comments section 202.216--effective date nprm did not propose specific effective date applicable prohibitions directives contained proposed rule one commenter requested consultation with department timeframe for implementation final rule some commenters requested department delay effective date rule--with requests ranging from months months indefinite deadline--to allow companies individuals universities time assess their data transactions update internal polices make necessary data security changes come into compliance without disrupting commercial activity two commenters suggested department pause rulemaking postpone publication final rule alternatively publish regulations for prohibited transactions first postpone publication restricted transactions later indeterminate date provide more time for consultation revisions those provisions department carefully considered these requests declines least this time categorically extend effective date beyond april department will however delay date for when u.s persons must comply with subpart related due diligence audit requirements for restricted transactions for sec sec 202.1103 202.1104 related certain reporting requirements for restricted transactions until october for reasons similar reasons why department declined extend comment period department declines these commenters request significantly delay effective date across board order anprm nprm parts iii this preamble explain this rule addresses national emergency unusual extraordinary threat national security foreign policy foreign adversaries are actively trying exploit commercial access americans sensitive personal data threaten u.s national security this threat increasingly urgent justifying expedited process for this rulemaking address threat significantly delaying effective date final rule across board would page 1644 give countries concern additional time collect government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data.\56 pressing risks posed these countries ongoing attempts collect exploit government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data detriment u.s national security weigh against extending effective date rule notwithstanding compliance burdens some commenters raised commenters request for significantly delayed effective date cannot reconciled with need expeditiously address these increasingly urgent serious risks united states persons have been notice regarding risks sharing sensitive personal data with countries concern for years united states government's recommended steps address those risks for example since least department homeland security dhs has publicly warned u.s businesses using data services from prc sharing data with prc about same risk vectors addressed this rule.\57 dhs security has urged u.s entities scrutinize any business relationship provides access data identifying sensitive personal proprietary information their possession minimiz[ing amount at-risk data being stored used prc places accessible prc authorities conducting r]obust due diligence transaction

considerations for businesses using data services equipment from firms linked china https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/20_1222_data-security-business-advisory.pdf https://perma.cc/2c5b-cewc united states persons have been aware this contemplated rulemaking since issuance order anrpm february 2024 during engagements with companies industry some participants suggested their efforts understand map their covered data transactions are already underway some other multinational companies explained already operate separate systems firewall u.s.-person data from access china other countries concern impose access controls prevent unauthorized foreign access similarly comments nprm different large global technology business stated multinational companies already have robust data privacy export control programs may leveraged comply with rule companies should not required set entirely new compliance programs another commenter echoed view companies should able leverage existing privacy data security programs but given serious national security concerns rule becomes effective for example before u.s person engaging restricted transactions able comply with security other requirements u.s person should not engage those transactions comments seeking significantly delay pause effective date did not offer adequate substantive analysis support necessary justify change these comments expressed general preference for delay but did not attempt for example identify what how many specific non-exempt transactions engage would prohibited restricted identify what specific controls recordkeeping systems currently have place why those are not sufficient comply identify what controls recordkeeping systems not have place now would required adopt comply with rule explain why those transactions could not paused terminated shifted non-countries concern non-covered persons before effective date specific impact doing department thus does not believe these comments provide adequate basis which justify significantly delayed effective for sectors industries represented commenters light pressing national security risks described order anprm nprm this preamble addition commenters requesting significantly delayed effective date represent specific sectors industries specific industries represented these commenters appear have different views about time resources needed for implementation not appear sufficiently representative entire category u.s persons engaging data transactions may prohibited restricted under rule department thus does not believe these comments justify across-the-board delay effective date result light need expeditiously address increasingly urgent national security threat lack significant specific countervailing evidence department believes appropriate for final rule establish effective date days starting point consistent with u.s.c 801(a)(3 u.s.c 553(d).\59 one end spectrum earlier effective date may mean more u.s persons are not prepared comply with rule who must delay forgo some cases transactions may implicate rule forgo broader suite business opportunities would not prohibited restricted under rule resulting temporary but additional costs while prepare comply other end spectrum later effective date would mean greater risk national security foreign policy while countries concern covered person have additional time access obtain exploit government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data department believes appropriate err side former given serious pressing risks these provisions--in particular u.s.c 801(a)(3 generally require effective date least days after publication rule federal register department has not invoked any exception these statutory requirements notwithstanding national emergency threat national security foreign policy addressed this rule although risks addressed this rule are urgent ongoing department recognizes breadth potential disruption current business activities associated economic interest more orderly process for coming into compliance with this rule department exercising its discretion balancing ongoing threats national security with potential disruption current business activities has therefore determined while blanket extension beyond days unwarranted also would not appropriate establish effective date earlier than department recognizes u.s persons may need time amend internal policies procedures ensure compliance with final rule's due diligence provisions comply with reporting requirements for example evaluating assessing ongoing transactions transaction types some aspects rule can delayed without unduly compromising national security interests advanced principal prohibitions restrictions subparts rule's due-diligence requirements for engaging restricted transactions recordkeeping requirements apply both prohibited restricted transactions are based existing compliance expectations set other page 1645 regulators such department treasury's office foreign asset control ofac department commerce's bureau industry security bis for screening vendors transaction counterparties department recognizes however specific burden applying these provisions this new context has determined appropriate allow additional time--an additional six months before those provisions become operative thus provisions sec sec 202.1001 202.1002 202.1103 202.1104 will only apply those who engage relevant transactions for sec 202.1104 reject proposed transaction after october department believes this will allow sufficient time for vast majority entities come into compliance with these provisions appropriately balances value these provisions combatting national security threat are intended address this delay will have effect phasing these additional compliance requirements allowing u.s persons focus their efforts start identifying understanding data transactions engage complying with prohibitions restrictions during 90-day period before rule's effective date additional period before remaining provisions become operative department will continue robustly engage with stakeholders determine whether additional time for implementation necessary appropriate through those engagements with more specific information department may determine for example appropriate for 90-day effective date remain effect but issue general license authorizing companies take additional time wind-down activities regulated rule cannot come into compliance before date for 90-day effective date remain effect but issue general license establishing delayed effective dates for specific sectors activities for 90-day effective date remain effect but issue general license further delaying effective date certain compliance requirements adjusting those requirements for 90-day effective date remain effect but issue non-enforcement policy for certain period delay effective date either through regulatory modification general license make changes department will also consider other courses action circumstances warrant several commenters requested department incorporate mechanism for continued engagement with public discuss assess rule's effectiveness light its application evolving technologies threats provide compliance guidance after department issues final rule department plans continue its robust stakeholder engagement has done throughout rulemaking process issue guidance compliance other topics addition through advisory opinion process rule provides formal avenue for public request receive clarifications about rule's applicability particular transactions finally section order already establishes formal mechanism for department assess effectiveness economic impact rule requiring report within one year after rule goes into effect which will include solicitation consideration public comments.\60 15427 few commenters requested clarification from department whether provisions rule will apply retroactively existing contracts provisions will only apply prospectively new contracts contracts for renewal one commenter requested department determines retroactive application required for provision sec 202.302 requiring certain contractual provisions for data brokerage transactions with foreign persons then department allow sufficient time amend existing agreements ensure compliance rule applies covered data transactions engaged after effective date covered data transactions completed prior effective date are not regulated rule however unless exempt otherwise authorized u.s persons knowingly engaging prohibited restricted covered data transaction after effective date are expected comply with rule notwithstanding any contract entered into any license permit granted before effective date case sec 202.302 for instance this means any relevant covered data transactions engaged after effective date must comply with contractual requirements sec 202.302(a)(1 even where u.s persons had existing agreement with foreign person prior effective date restricted prohibited transactions will not grandfathered compliant simply because any resulting covered data transactions are subject preexisting contract agreement significant national security concerns outlined order nprm parts ii-iv this preamble require these regulations implemented quickly possible entities believe need more time come into compliance with these regulations may request specific license subpart c--prohibited transactions related activities proposed rule identified transactions are categorically prohibited unless proposed rule otherwise authorizes them pursuant exemption general specific license for categories restricted transactions compliance with security requirements other requirements set forth proposed rule section 202.210--covered data transactions order authorizes attorney general issue regulations prohibit otherwise restrict u.s persons from engaging transaction where among other things attorney general has determined transaction member class transactions pose unacceptable risk national security united states because transactions may enable countries concern covered persons access bulk sensitive personal data united states government-related data manner contributes national emergency declared this o]rder pursuant order proposed rule categorically prohibited for categories restricted transactions imposed security other requirements certain covered data transactions with u.s persons countries concern covered persons because covered data transactions may otherwise enable countries concern covered persons access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data harm u.s national security 15423 proposed rule defined covered data transaction any transaction involves any access any government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data involves data brokerage vendor agreement employment agreement investment agreement stated nprm department has determined these categories covered data transactions pose unacceptable risk u.s national security because may enable countries concern page 1646 covered persons access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data engage malicious cyber-enabled activities track build profiles united states individuals for illicit purposes including blackmail espionage intimidate curb political dissent political opposition otherwise limit civil liberties u.s persons opposed countries concern among other harms u.s national security for instance one study has demonstrated foreign malign actors can purchase bulk quantities sensitive personal data about u.s military personnel from data brokers for coercion reputational damage blackmail sherman supra note some commenters suggested final rule limited situations where government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data made accessible u.s person covered person country concern not apply instances where for example covered person sends bulk u.s sensitive personal data u.s person department agrees u.s person accessing data from covered person ordinarily does not present national security concerns rule seeks address department does not intend rule cover generic circumstance although commenters identified multiple ways clarify this regulatory text department clarifies this limitation changing definition covered data transaction cover only transactions involve access country concern covered person rule includes new example clarifying this limitation sec 202.210 this change also necessitates conforming changes sec 202.302 related onward transfer provisions explained part iv.b.15 this preamble other commenters requested clarity about whether rule would apply other transactions are related covered data transaction but not themselves provide country concern covered person access bulk u.s sensitive personal data government-related data revised definition covered data transaction captures only those transactions involve access country concern covered person bulk u.s sensitive personal data government-related data term access defined rule rule does not impose any restrictions prohibitions transactions not involve access country concern covered person government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data for instance u.s research institution entered into vendor agreement with covered person cloud-services provider country concern store bulk u.s personal health data bulk human genomic data country concern would have comply with security requirements mandated subpart but rule would not impose any restrictions prohibitions ability u.s foreign persons who are not covered persons access analyze bulk u.s sensitive personal data stored country concern cloud services provider section 202.301--prohibited data-brokerage transactions section 202.214--data brokerage nprm proposed prohibiting any u.s person from knowingly engaging covered data transaction involving data brokerage with country concern covered person proposed rule defined data brokerage sale data licensing access data similar commercial transactions involving transfer data from any person provider any other person recipient where recipient did not collect process data directly from individuals linked linkable collected processed data some comments expressed concern with perceived breadth term data brokerage these comments did not appropriately consider data brokerage context rest regulations such their exemptions other elements prohibitions restrictions other related definitions limit scope impact data brokerage such made exaggerated claims about its impacts without support analysis these comments were premised largely imprecise hypotheticals generalizations misstated regulations addition none these comments discussing data brokerage addressed national security risk posed countries concern covered persons accessing digital footprint sensitive personal data americans leave behind when interacting with modern world nevertheless department considered each such comment responds themes presented them continuing discussion extent such commenters reiterated points suggestions were already addressed nprm department directs those commenters relevant discussions nprm.\63 ultimately department declines make any changes prohibition sec 202.301 makes limited change definition data brokerage sec 202.214 adds three new examples definition amends one existing example see e.g 86130-31 some commenters recommended department adjust definition data brokerage expressly exclude activities are already subject one proposed rule's exemptions ensure proposed regulations not inadvertently capture transactions are well-regulated financial services regulators change was made response this comment exemptions subpart already explicitly make clear prohibitions restrictions subparts not apply categories exempt transactions sec 202.301 provision prohibiting certain data-brokerage transactions already explicitly applies e]xcept otherwise authorized pursuant subparts this part any other provision this part which includes exemptions subpart adding another reference this issue would redundant unnecessary some commenters expressed confusion about supposed relationship tension between data brokerage vendor agreements suggested changes would undermine prohibitions restrictions associated with those defined terms for example these commenters believed intra-company data transactions could considered prohibited data brokerage but claimed same transaction would only restricted engaged pursuant vendor agreement some these commenters others also requested changes exemption for corporate group transactions sec 202.506 address their confusion data brokerage vendor agreements are specifically tailored address risk national security posed country concern covered person's access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data while commenters hypothetical questions concerns lack factual specificity for additional clarity department has amended definition data brokerage explicitly exclude employment investment vendor agreement this change helps ensure categories prohibited transactions restricted transactions remain mutually exclusive applying these definitions still involves fact-specific analysis illustrated page 1647 accompanying examples department also added two new examples sec sec 202.214(b)(7 further illustrate how companies primarily engaged non-data brokerage activities might otherwise trigger prohibition addition extent intra-company internal data transactions satisfy exemption under sec 202.506 because are ordinarily incident part administrative ancillary business operations those transactions would exempt regardless whether are characterized prohibited data brokerage restricted vendor agreement furthermore after effective date rule commenters broader public will have opportunity submit detailed requests for formal advisory opinions from department regarding any questions have how these terms affect specific factual situations opposed hypothetical ones least one commenter suggested department amend definition data brokerage omitting licensing access data similar commercial transactions prongs limiting scope those transactions where sensitive data exchanged for consideration alternative commenter suggested department narrow scope apply specific types transactions department intends cover commenter argued current definition data brokerage overbroad extends beyond bulk sensitive personal data all data broad interpretation similar commercial transactions could expand scope compliance impact actors several sectors such e-commerce analytics firms other commenters suggested striking similar commercial transactions from definition amending including adopting standards found certain state privacy laws others asked department reiterate concepts like sensitive personal data definition data brokerage department declines adopt these suggested approaches parts which were already discussed nprm department intends for rule cover broad range data brokerage transactions involving government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data persons selling reselling data others are engaging data brokerage even such activity not person's primary business activity noted nprm proposed rule intentionally covered both first third-party data brokerage because countries concern not discriminate how seek access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data such rule's broad definition critical ensuring there are significant loopholes for countries concern continue leverage data brokerage market means acquiring exploiting government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data department also notes these comments appear misapply data brokerage its relationship other provisions regulations for example prohibition data brokerage does not apply all data only applies covered data transactions which limited government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data adding sensitive personal data definition term would therefore redundant phrase similar commercial transactions intended cover other commercial arrangements beyond just sales licensing involving transfer government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data countries concern covered persons commercial arrangements their nature are engaged for consideration further clarification phrase warranted necessary additionally exemption sec 202.505 regarding financial services already ensures term similar commercial transactions would not inadvertently capture e-commerce activities moreover these comments suggestions not realistically describe how whether their recommended approaches would mitigate national security risk associated with rule's examples data-brokerage activities other than sale licensing another commenter suggested comply with regulations companies must first identify any data-brokerage activities undertake which commenter claims daunting task commenter also warned definition would include activities beyond those engaged data brokerage firms many commenter's concerns were addressed preamble nprm department intends for data brokerage encompass both first third-party data brokerage address national security risk order was intended mitigate key national security feature program addressed earlier part iv.b.2 this preamble with respect how comply with regulations department does not endorse any specific practice department believes more effective have u.s persons develop compliance programs suitable their own individualized risk profile explained nprm.\64 such programs can vary based range factors including u.s person's size sophistication products services customers counterparties geographic locations department may issue guidance this topic assist u.s persons develop implement compliance programs without fully knowing commenter's situation alternative approaches compliance may appropriate such first evaluating company's exposure countries concern covered persons their possession access government related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data direct their compliance efforts 86128 least two commenters proposed exempting data-sharing platforms from definition data brokerage because such platforms not determine what data shared reviewed before data shared these commenters generally claimed without requested exemption such platforms would required review all data exchanges underlying datasets potentially creating new privacy data security risks well possible contractual violations department declines adopt this proposal because unnecessary redundant risks creating exemption could inadvertently undermine purpose rule thereby exacerbating national security risk order intended mitigate prohibition sec 202.301 requires knowingly engaging covered data transaction involving data brokerage with country concern covered person examples sec sec 202.230(b 202.305(b illustrate u.s person merely provides infrastructure platform u.s customer uses infrastructure platform engage prohibited restricted transaction third-party infrastructure platform provider would not generally have knowingly engaged prohibited restricted transaction however would inappropriate for rule exempt third-party infrastructure platform providers could engage their own transactions would prohibited restricted also illustrated examples sec 202.230(b sec 202.305(b least two commenters were concerned without changes definition data brokerage prohibition sec 202.301 regulations would adversely affect e-commerce page 1648 ability u.s persons purchase goods services these concerns are unfounded because prohibition does not reach exempted activities including data transactions are ordinarily incident part provision financial services financial services include transfer personal financial data covered personal identifiers incidental purchase sale goods services provision processing payments funds transfers see sec 202.505(a)(4 example sec 202.505(b)(1 also specifically addresses issue e-commerce one comment expressed concern u.s persons engaged data brokerage are unfairly targeted encouraged creation safe harbor for u.s persons conduct due diligence data-brokerage transactions but are later deceived about foreign adversary's ownership control customer company department declines adopt described safe harbor because unnecessary redundant prohibition data brokerage sec 202.301 requires u.s person act knowingly which means person has actual knowledge reasonably should have known conduct circumstance result see sec 202.230 generally u.s persons engaged data brokerage who are fact deceived countries concern covered persons despite taking reasonable measures comply with sec 202.301 would not liable because would not have had actual knowledge nor would have reasonably known circumstances addition department intends issue compliance enforcement guidance following publication final rule another commenter provided several open-ended hypotheticals about applicability definition data brokerage sec 202.214 unfunded nonprofit research asked whether u.s person's transfer bulk sensitive personal data researcher country concern could considered data brokerage whether such data transfers would prohibited occurred because mutual interest research whether possibility collaboration co-authoring paper constitutes sufficient consideration trigger definition public will have opportunity submit detailed requests for formal advisory opinions after effective date regulations process filers would provide non-hypothetical specific facts which department will render opinion applicability regulations without more specific information details department can only provide general answers these hypotheticals explained with respect comments sec 202.511 while rule not limited covered data transactions occur for solely commercial purposes rule does limit data brokerage other categories covered data transactions thus prohibitions restrictions transactions are commercial nature meaning involve some payment other valuable consideration generally without more mutual interest conducting research together possibility research collaboration authoring paper would not constitute kind valuable consideration needed qualify covered data transaction department added examples sec 202.214 clarify circumstances which department intends rule apply context such research activities other commenters similarly sought clarification whether how rule applies nonprofit non-commercial entities rule applies data brokerage investment vendor employment transactions defined rule without regard for-profit not-for-profit nature u.s person engaged transaction where nonprofit engages covered data transaction--by for example entering vendor agreement with covered person host bulk u.s sensitive personal data--the rule applies nprm explained rule takes activity-based approach because certain activities transactions pose unacceptable risks national security foreign policy regardless kind entity engages them however other provisions regulations might exempt otherwise prohibited restricted data transactions engaged researchers department has exempted data transactions arising from official business united states government federal law international agreements drug biological medical device authorizations other clinical trials sec sec 202.504 202.507 202.510 202.511 respectively section 202.504 also covers data transactions conducted pursuant contract grant other agreement with federal departments agencies even when there concurrent funding from non-federal sources least one commenter suggested prohibited data brokerage should limited circumstances which recipient data receives right remedy power privilege interest with respect data department declines make suggested change because fails adequately address national security risk posed countries concern covered persons access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data commenter's suggestion would undermine data-brokerage prohibition effectively give adversarial nations unfettered access bulk u.s sensitive personal data government-related data subpart regulations offer carefully tailored exemptions balance national security imperatives order with legitimate economic humanitarian activities among others data transactions qualify for such exemptions would not prohibited under this program one commenter sought clarification changes regarding example sec 202.214 whether assuming all other requirements prohibition sec 202.301 were satisfied internet protocol addresses advertising identifiers alone without bulk precise geolocation information would constitute prohibited data brokerage department revised example clarify data transaction involving bulk quantities u.s users addresses advertising ids would qualify prohibited data-brokerage transaction involving bulk covered personal identifiers because addresses advertising ids are listed identifiers however data transaction involving only one listed identifiers--for example only addresses--would not qualify covered data transaction because addresses isolation not qualify sensitive personal data countries concern may use addresses some instances aid identifying location particular device user however department recognizes addresses alone may not provide enough detailed information about specific user device qualify precise geolocation data department understands most commercial instances addresses are collected datasets often contain well into tens hundreds millions such addresses often involve other listed identifiers well given this reality department will only treat addresses listed identifier rather than also precise geolocation data page 1649 another commenter recommended narrowing definition data brokerage primarily striking phrase similar commercial transactions from definition which department discussed part iv.b.2 this preamble commenter also provided some high level examples activities believe should not considered data brokerage marketplace sales which third-party seller located country concern covered person provides items for sale u.s persons platforms owned u.s persons retail advertising networks are owned u.s companies feature advertisers who are covered persons are based country concern personal health data human genomic data for scientific research regulatory purposes provisions services u.s individuals abroad this preamble nprm explained department declines revise definition data brokerage because intentionally designed scoped address activity data brokerage gives rise national risk regardless entity engages intentionally regulates data transactions give rise risks order was intended mitigate.\65 commenter did not address how whether their recommended approach data brokerage would mitigate such risk addition rule already accounts for examples provided commenter transactions ordinarily incident provision covered personal identifiers personal financial data part e-commerce such marketplace sales are generally exempt under financial services exemption with respect scientific research regulatory purposes rule does not prohibit research country concern research partnerships with covered person not otherwise involve covered data transaction exemptions sec sec 202.510 202.511 already exempt certain data transactions arising from clinical trials regulatory approvals context drug biological medical device authorizations commenter failed provide sufficient specificity for department address other examples provided recommended change therefore appears unnecessary this time 86131 because data-brokerage prohibition along with other prohibitions restrictions center around data transactions involving access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data department addresses comments received those key terms related terms detail following discussion section 202.201--access proposed rule defined access logical physical access including ability obtain read copy decrypt edit divert release affect alter state otherwise view receive any form including through information systems information technology systems cloud-computing platforms networks security systems equipment software one commenter requested ensure compliance mechanisms not impede legitimate research activities department distinguish data access data export commenter interpreted access data physically obtaining data being able analyze data remote analysis environment where data remains protected cannot exported this end commenter recommended addressing security concerns while maintaining legitimate users access research data requiring data accessor attestation leveraging trusted research environments adopt modern data protection methods multi-layer security protocols department declines distinguish access from export national security context

department sought comments about whether how should regulate transactions involving access bulk human omic data other than human genomic data department received several comments this topic including one supported robust regulation others either opposed including other human omic data rule proposed delaying its inclusion separate rulemaking after further consideration department has determined final rule treat three categories other human omic data--epigenomic data proteomic data transcriptomic data--similarly its treatment human genomic data bulk threshold for these additional categories human omic data will higher than for human genomic data department not including any other categories human omic data rule this time department incorporates this change defining new term human omic data includes human genomic data each three listed other human omic categories high level omics sciences examine biological processes contribute form function cells tissues.\82 many commenters urged department move cautiously regulating other human omic data avoid disrupting development new promising fields research although none these comments spoke with any specificity about risks regulating covered data transactions contemplated nprm department agrees cautious approach needed see e.g evolution translational omics lessons learned path forward christine micheel eds 2012 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk202168/pdf/bookshelf_nbk202168.pdf https://perma.cc/q5ye-7xlm department recognizes not all categories human omics data present same degree risk accessed country concern covered person data from some human omic categories for example not present same identifiability concerns exist for human genomic data but department remains deeply concerned national security risk associated with transactions involving human epigenomic proteomic transcriptomic data fields epigenomics proteomics transcriptomics are--after genomics--the most advanced omic fields.\83 generally speaking epigenomics study changes gene expression not involve alterations dna sequence itself field proteomics generally aims identify characterize proteins study their structures functions interactions post-translational modifications field transcriptomics generally aims understand gene expression patterns alternative splicing regulation rna molecules these three human omic categories have greatest clinical predictive capacity especially when used combination with genomics other omic categories because are most closely related genomics carly cox information gathered potential impact including omic data rule access sensitive u.s data appendix science technology policy institute nov 2024 hereinafter stpi report citing dai shen 2022 full stpi report available regulations.gov docket nsd-104 data these categories may used countries concern numerous ways this includes risk related identifiability particularly for human transcriptomic data but also one commenter indicated for human epigenomic data human proteomic data human meta-multiomic data.\84 but risks are not limited identifiability countries concern might leverage access bulk u.s human omic data other ways are adverse u.s national interests same attributes make this data useful for general research make potentially useful for nefarious purposes--for example train systems enabling military capabilities adversaries undermining u.s bioeconomy additionally classified reporting reviewed department further underscores risks allowing countries concern access u.s person data these categories see e.g patrycja daca-roszak ewa zietkiewicz transcriptome variation human populations its potential application forensics appl genet 319 nov 2019 https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-019-00510-1 addition comments department has also reviewed november 2024 limited study performed science technology policy institute stpi sought preliminarily evaluate effect ongoing planned research department regulated human genomic other human omic data this rulemaking.\85 study which used various methods estimate effect contemplated regulations research efforts including surveying interviewing potentially impacted stakeholders concluded there was unlikely substantial disruption research report though limited its scope methodology concluded only small proportion u.s research community participating research involves collaboration with country concern even among groups have existing research collaborations with country concern none those collaborations involved data sharing would constitute transaction bulk human omic data stpi's review clinical trials identified only single clinical trial currently active united states involves more than 100 participants gathers omic this case transcriptomic genomic data has site china.\87 see stpi report supra note report found generally low levels clinical trials any sort also involved site country concern most concerns identified stpi report arose from general compliance concerns such federal funding entities would impose different requirements researchers would have adjust computer security protocols for example one interviewee noted took substantially longer build infrastructure facilitate data sharing when cybersecurity requirements had met.\87 another thought research would slowed because confusion page 1655 about scope rule during implementation.\88 one interviewee observed institutional burden complying with new rules would limit collaboration with researchers countries concern.\89 hard disentangle these concerns from other provisions rule likely also regulating these three categories other human omic data will pose only limited marginal costs research industry compared costs attributable other aspects rule including provisions pertaining human genomic data indeed one interviewee expressly predicted including other human omic data scope regulation would have change regulatory burden because omic research almost always also involves genomic data.\90 given significant national security risks posed country concern covered person access these data limited available evidence characterize marginal disruptive effect regulating these human omics categories immaturity research commercialization these human omics related applications present department has determined regulate these three categories human omic data one commenter expressed support for inclusion provisions regulating other human omic data noting these restrictions will significantly bolster u.s biodefense biosecurity commenter noted bulk human omics data should viewed providing insight into how body affected changes environment diet infectious non-communicable diseases other circumstances commenter encouraged department implement regulations restricting transfer human omic data noting united states concerned about outside entity using human genomic data maliciously attack american public via biological threats then information gathered via other human omic data--especially proteomics metabolomics--should considered equally perhaps more sensitive department appreciates this comment for current rulemaking however department has chosen focus most acute threats related human omic data department may revisit regulating transactions involving additional human omic data future rulemaking one comment offered specific helpful suggestions for revising department's proposed definitions department greatly appreciates this comment has incorporated commenter's suggestions applicable three additional categories human omic data final rule for example definition human proteomic data now expressly excludes routine clinical measurements department made similar changes definitions human epigenomic data human transcriptomic data final rule also clarifies human proteomic human epigenomic human transcriptomic data include only data derived from systems-level analysis nprm department indicated was considering carving out pathogen data omic datasets one commenter strongly supported this exclusion explaining pathogen-related data serves important unique public health functions preamble nprm department explained would take similar approach which commenter suggested with respect human genomic data final rule department expressly excludes from definition human omic data pathogen-specific data embedded omic data sets another commenter stressed department includes other human omic data must also include them exemptions subpart including for regulatory approval data clinical investigations sec sec 202.510 202.511 department agrees those provisions already exempt transactions within their scope from provisions subparts which are operative provisions prohibiting restricting transactions application those exemptions does not turn type data involved exemptions apply equally transactions involving human omic data other categories sensitive personal data numerous commenters stressed bulk thresholds for other human omic categories identified nprm should vary with risk should higher than threshold for human genomic data commenters did not provide specific input what those thresholds should which omics categories should have relatively higher lower thresholds except phenomics probably presented lower risk three additional omic categories department regulating are those with greatest national security risks this time but department agrees given nascency these fields relatively greater difficulty using these omic data for identification bulk thresholds for these categories should higher than for human genomic data some stakeholders requested simpler rules minimize compliance costs department recognizes independent individual risk analysis there benefit setting thresholds for all human omics categories same level but many use cases this type data used together with genomic data there may limited practical effects setting different thresholds for these human omics categories.\88 for these reasons department uses threshold 1,000 u.s persons for all these three additional categories human omic data epigenomic proteomic transcriptomic data while maintaining 100 u.s person threshold for human genomic data set out nprm see e.g stpi report supra note section 202.240--personal financial data proposed rule defined personal financial data data about individual's credit charge debit card bank account including purchases payment history data including assets liabilities debts transactions bank credit other financial statement data credit report consumer report defined u.s.c 1681a(d one commenter sought clarification whether personal financial history pertains solely transactions with financial institutions includes all purchase payment history department interprets this question asking about scope term personal financial data department confirms personal financial data sec 202.240 including payment history applies across board not limited purchases payment history collected only financial institutions another commenter suggested department clarify personal financial data only includes information from sources like banks credit statements not from vendors merchants search engines e-commerce records department declines adopt recommendation while such records are not automatically considered personal financial data any record contains data about individual's credit charge debit card bank account including purchases payment history data bank credit other financial statement credit report consumer report meets definition see sec 202.240 same commenter suggested personal page 1656 financial data should only restricted when comes directly from individual's bank accounts however focus definition final rule content records documents information containing personal financial data not necessarily source proposed rule explained countries concern covered persons seek such personal financial data from any source can combine with other data create vulnerabilities malicious actors might exploit posing national security risks.\89 therefore department declines limit definition based data source see e.g 86161 section 202.241--personal health data proposed rule defined personal health data health information relates past present future physical mental health condition individual provision healthcare individual past present future payment for provision healthcare individual term includes basic physical measurements health attributes such bodily functions height weight vital signs symptoms allergies social psychological

suggested department remove past present future payment for provision healthcare individual social psychological behavioral logs exercise habits from definition personal health information this commenter argued medical expenditures are helpful construction communication medical treatment systems but cannot directly reflect someone's disease diagnosis treatment thus should not restricted same commenter also asserted without explanation social psychological behavioral sports habits are too broad pose any threat national security department declines adopt recommendation medical expenditures can revealing about nature diagnosis medical issue for example medical billing statements often come with diagnostic codes show services provided medical practitioner facility expenditure specific location e.g oncology office obstetrics office dialysis center can similarly reveal information about health conditions likewise data such social psychological behavioral habits specific individual

interests critical for research leads medical advancements another commenter argued department's cited studies did not offer definitive evidence re-identification truly anonymized data real risk but commenter provided evidence contradict cited studies support their conclusion another commenter said control measures for anonymized pseudonymized de-identified data should different than control measures for unprocessed original data finally one commenter noted department should instead direct dhs identify standards for de-identifying anonymizing data meet certain requirements other commenters suggested definitions government related data also exclude data subject robust encryption measures including but not limited data protected via post quantum cryptography algorithms approved national institute standards technology nist withstand quantum computer attacks few commenters opposed inclusion encrypted data based proposed cisa security requirements relating data minimization data masking strategies for restricted transactions one commenter noted inclusion encrypted data does not represent carefully calibrated action would curtail usefulness privacy-enhancing technologies even though some these were explicitly included proposed cisa security requirements this same commenter stated without providing any support quantum-computing capabilities could used decipher encrypted data are too far from being operational decrypt bulk data another commenter noted adopting exemption for these algorithms would incentivize better encryption promote post-quantum

revise bulk thresholds for covered personal identifiers personal financial data response these comments discussed part iv.b this preamble bulk thresholds are set based risk-based assessment accounts for characteristics different categories sensitive personal data affect data's vulnerability exploitation countries concern well consequences exploitation these commenters did not offer any analysis evidence about compliance burdens financial institutions nor did explain kinds volume non-exempt covered data transactions these institutions would engaged especially light financial services exemption likely covers most those institutions global data activities addition while these two commenters considered impact thresholds only terms compliance burdens for single financial institution department must also consider impact thresholds collectively department believes with respect addressing national security risk thresholds should primarily examined from perspective access provided countries concern covered persons across all covered data transactions rather than from perspective single u.s person's transactions with single foreign person thresholds are higher countries concern will able obtain unrestricted access significantly larger amounts bulk u.s sensitive data across thousands potentially tens thousands transactions for example u.s persons each give same covered person access genomic data u.s persons--a seemingly small number then country concern would able potentially obtain unrestricted access genomic data nearly 5,000 u.s persons explained above this part data those 5,000 u.s persons could reasonably used identify individuals extrapolate insights about population are orders magnitude page 1661 larger using basic statistical inference techniques.\98 sinharay supra note put this into perspective raising bulk threshold for covered personal identifiers one order magnitude million u.s persons would allow country concern government buy passport numbers social security numbers every u.s person who lives city san francisco from u.s company--and buy from other u.s companies same data for every u.s person detroit washington las vegas jacksonville similarly raising bulk threshold for personal health data personal financial data one order magnitude 100,000 u.s persons would allow u.s companies store treatments test results financial transactions debts assets every u.s person who works for t-mobile ford citigroup mcdonald's general motors data center operated country concern state-owned enterprise with zero security precautions mitigate risk access data those examples illustrate unacceptable national security risks would result from significantly raising thresholds allowing country concern readily assemble exploit structured set pattern-of-life data representative american population for these reasons department must prioritize cumulative national security impacts transactions across various data categories over compliance burdens individual entities especially when meaningful evidence analysis has been presented latter topic department therefore adopts proposed bulk thresholds without change section 202.222--government-related data

entities comply with sec 202.302 regarding reporting requirement one commenter asked department exclude inadvertent good faith minimis violations contracts another commenter argued use contractual language prevent onward transfer data countries concern covered persons was significant step but emphasized some countries entities might find alternative means transfer data recommended department extensively track monitor compliance another commenter asked department provide standard contractual clauses meet department's expectations about contractual requirements department declines prescribe specific due diligence requirements for compliance with sec 202.302 because overly prescriptive requirements will not fit risk profile operations all u.s persons department discussed detail nprm department expects u.s persons will develop compliance programs fit their own individualized risk profiles depending variety factors minimum however u.s persons must conduct sufficient due diligence able comply with reporting requirements which could include periodic reviews with foreign counterparties ensure have complied with contract department anticipates issuing general compliance guidance which may include sample contractual clauses suggest potential ways track monitor compliance regarding excepting minimis good faith inadvertent contract violations without specific example department cannot envision what such violations requirement would specifically sec 202.302 requires u.s person report when foreign person has engaged covered data transaction--that transaction involves access country concern covered person any government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data any violation this contractual term gives country concern covered person access page 1663 sensitive personal data inherently not minimis moreover reporting requirement does not require u.s persons report contractual violations unrelated this provision such foreign person missing reporting requirement few days other minor contractual provisions because nature national security risks even good-faith inadvertent violations contractual provision may still result harm u.s national security enabling access country concern covered person government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data through data brokerage for those reasons department declines modify reporting requirement account for minimis

circumstances result u.s person had actual knowledge reasonably should have known about conduct circumstances result determine what individual entity reasonably should have known context prohibited transactions department will consider relevant facts circumstances including sophistication individual entity scale sensitivity data involved extent which parties transaction appeared aware department declines adopt actual knowledge standard because knowingly standard acknowledges doctrine willful blindness legal concept where person intentionally avoids knowing about something illegal wrong even though suspect might happening for example imagine u.s entity engaging covered data transaction involving data brokerage with foreign person not covered person has contractually required foreign person refrain from engaging subsequent covered data transaction involving data brokerage same data with country concern covered person u.s entity suspects foreign person may not complying with its contractual obligations but instead investigating u.s entity deliberately ignores signs evidence maintain plausible deniability under rule's knowingly standard this u.s entity can should still responsible because purposefully avoided truth other words u.s entity should have known about violation contractual requirements taken steps report several commenters asked whether sec 202.302 would

occurring across every country network globe comment then described context cloud computing perceived difficulties with determining bulk data thresholds data content covered persons three categories restricted transactions light knowingly standard this comment seems entirely misconstrue how knowledge standard works vis-[agrave]-vis cloud providers their customers department has not suggested cloud provider necessarily held responsible for whether its u.s person customers are making their data available via provider's cloud platform country concern covered person part restricted transaction rather department seeking ensure cloud provider itself enters into restricted transaction relying employees vendors are covered persons taking certain investments from covered persons would afford those covered persons with access their customer's bulk u.s sensitive personal data then consistent with requirements these regulations such department makes changes result this comment another commenter argued rule makes problematic assumptions about emerging technologies broad knowingly standard exacerbates example pointed example sec 202.301(b)(1 arguing example assumes chatbot

obtaining direct access underlying government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data addition applying organizational system-level requirements department expects complying with security requirements will not ordinarily result facto prohibition restricted transactions instead would typically permit restricted transactions forward cisa's final security requirements point out u.s business could choose fully deny covered person access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data while still executing restricted transaction would otherwise allow access business's

regulated entities have instituted adequate data-level requirements addition organizational system level requirements sure possible what department expects relatively rare circumstances only service

employment agreements within scope restricted transactions related national security risk articulated nprm noted legal political regimes countries concern enable page 1671 them compel employees who work for their companies within their territory share information with these governments including their intelligence services creating significant risk u.s national security further rule itself does

government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data linkable identifiable unencrypted decryptable using commonly available technology covered persons and/or countries concern consistent with required data risk assessment this rule not discriminatory does not turn racial ethnic national identity instead rule identifies categories covered persons based risk country concern could leverage such person entity access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data criteria sec 202.211(a does not indiscriminately apply for example everyone chinese nationality contrary covered person categories distinguish between non-u.s citizens who primarily reside country concern who are covered persons because are subject jurisdiction legal regimes country concern's government non-u.s

covered persons unless designated because weaker categorical ability countries concern subject them country concern's jurisdiction otherwise direct control their actions such rule adopts proposed approach from nprm without change one commenter asked for additional clarification regarding exemptions related chinese national receives employment particularly for instances where chinese nationals are employed united states through immigration process although this question not entirely clear commenter appears asking whether provisions regarding restricted transactions would apply employment agreement between country concern's national u.s company while national's application for change immigration status pending answer depends several additional facts chinese national employed united states living united states then individual meet definition u.s person which includes any person united states such individual not foreign person would therefore not meet criteria any categories covered persons unless individually designated this scenario therefore employment agreement between chinese national u.s company would not restricted transaction because between two u.s persons contrast chinese national primarily resident country concern works outside united states for government country concern for another covered person has been designated covered person then individual would covered person scenario result employment agreement between chinese national u.s company would restricted transaction fact chinese national has applied for pending change u.s immigration status would not alter individual's status covered person with respect change immigration status national would become u.s person under sec 202.256 thus their status covered person unless designated only upon actual change in--not mere application for change in--their status such are admitted united states refugee under u.s.c 1157 granted asylum under u.s.c 1158 become u.s citizen national lawful permanent resident change rule necessary clarify this point same commenter remarked provisions restricted transactions impose substantial constraints employment agreements countries concern potentially creating compliance challenges extend beyond u.s jurisdiction commenter noted these restrictions could hinder legal structuring employment agreements which must also adhere foreign regulatory requirements urged department consider adjustments regulations avoid conflicts with foreign data protection laws first department clarifies rule regulates u.s persons engaging covered data transactions involve employee agreements with covered persons countries concern does not target employment agreements countries concern next commenter did not provide support analysis for their assertions rule imposes substantial constraints would potentially hinder entering into such agreements create conflicts with foreign data protection laws department reiterates rule does not prevent employment agreements with covered persons countries concern but instead requires u.s companies meet certain security requirements other applicable requirements lastly department finds unpersuasive commenter's argument making companies adhere foreign regulatory requirements would hinder legal structuring employment agreements navigating domestic foreign regulations provisions inherent nature engaging cross-border business even separate from this rule another commenter asked department whether unpaid service volunteer board would considered other consideration value benefit derived from one's experience can constitute other consideration part exchange for services rendered even volunteer basis for charitable humanitarian purposes change has been made this provision result this

generally provisions sec 202.401 regulate u.s persons engaging restricted transactions involving employment agreement with country concern covered person absent evasion avoidance scenarios fact patterns wherein foreign person causes u.s person violate provisions this rule foreign persons are not restricted from engaging employment agreements with covered persons change rule necessary

persons attorney general has designated covered person nprm noted entity automatically covered person foreign person percent more owned directly indirectly country concern organized chartered under

has its principal place business country concern foreign person entity percent more owned directly indirectly individually aggregate one more persons described sec sec 202.211(a)(1 these technical corrections which not alter intended scope criteria for covered persons were necessary for three reasons first department streamlined language sec 202.211(a)(2 references subsections covered person criteria for sake clarity concision second department changed 50-percent rule language sec sec 202.211(a)(1 more closely match ofac's 50-percent rule language because department intends for rules generally applied similar manner this corrected language will capture was originally intended indirect ownership relates certain complex ownership structures--such where two covered persons each own minority stakes subsidiary but their aggregate ownership meets exceeds 50-percent threshold consistent with ofac's implementation 50-percent rule third department added persons described sec 202.211(a)(2 this section ensure foreign persons are entities percent more owned covered person are scope again this technical correction not expansion intended scope this category covered persons instead this correction aligns category with description nprm which says entity also covered person foreign person percent more owned directly indirectly covered person 178 this therefore does not present substantive change scope proposed nprm.\179 178 86148 179 86148-50 one commenter suggested department refine covered person definition avoid under inclusion overinclusion commenter noted entity percent owned country concern presents same risk entity with percent ownership even though latter would not automatically considered covered person commenter correct entity controlled but not percent more owned one more covered persons countries concern not categorically considered covered person under sec 202.211(a this time however department does not believe significant minority interest necessarily presents same level risk majority interest such 50-percent rule should lowered other considerations--including need for objective brightline rule industry's experience complying with 50-percent rule other national security contexts--justify adherence 50-percent rule department agrees however controlling interest may present risks access which why control one criteria for department designate entity covered person under sec 202.211(a)(5 such entity determined meet relevant criteria u.s persons should exercise caution when considering engaging covered data transactions with entity not covered person but which one more covered persons have significant ownership less than percent which one more covered persons may control means other than majority ownership interest ownership percentages can fluctuate such entity could become covered person such entities may designated department based significant controlling interest additionally persons should cautious dealing with such entity ensure are not engaging evasion avoidance regulations one commenter recommended department consider applying knowledge-based standard currently employed bis export control rules which prohibits u.s persons from proceeding with transaction have actual knowledge violation export administration regulations has occurred about occur justification commenter explained companies meet

https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/6186/download?inline https://perma.cc/q87v-vzjq several commenters asserted categories covered persons are too broad these comments however are generally premised various misapplications categories for page 1690 example one commenter noted concern company's association with country concern would restrict company from receiving data from u.s companies commenter further noted this concern especially salient for entities covered persons list are owned country concern entity located those countries but company does not become covered person merely for having association with country concern covered person listed sec 202.211(a criteria for falling into covered person category for being designated covered person are more rigorous than merely having associated with country concern covered person scope categories covered persons correlated risk person entity could leveraged country concern for access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data company merely being associated with country concern covered person absent reason believe meet sec 202.211(a criteria does not rise level risk rule intends address exaggeration rule's prohibitions another example another commenter claimed there are million registered firms one countries concern asserted all them would considered covered persons under rule section 202.211(a does not categorically treat entity covered person just because registered country concern instead covers foreign person entities are organized chartered under laws have their principal place business country concern registration business country legally different than being organized under laws country having principal place business there latter far narrower scope than those merely registered country concern which could include for example companies business country those are not subject direction control its government but register order protect their intellectual property additionally rule does not require u.s persons identify catalogue every individual entity meets covered person criteria instead rule requires u.s persons examine their much smaller demographic current prospective clients vendors employees investors determine whether those individuals entities meet criteria sec 202.211(a this commenter has chosen mis-frame rule requires u.s person boil ocean identify every covered person world when merely requires u.s person boil their own pot know their own customers vendors employees investors same commenter stated every single vendor employment investment agreement with these registered entities would subject department's rule again this comment misapplies rule artificially inflating its scope commenter neglects consider any other elements scoping rule other than limited onward-transfer provision rule regulates only enumerated types commercial transactions u.s persons with countries concern covered persons give those countries covered persons access government-related data six types bulk u.s sensitive personal data meet exceed bulk thresholds where none exemptions general licenses specific licenses apply this comment also neglects consider rule does not prohibit restricted transactions but rather allows u.s persons engage such transactions under condition comply with certain security other requirements another commenter expressed concerns some may misinterpret rule prohibiting u.s persons from allowing foreign researchers country concern nationality access americans data such commenter requested clarification whether foreign researchers working for companies outside countries concern are excluded from rule's provisions even such foreign researchers are country concern nationality under rule's definition covered person foreign individual such researcher who national country concern would not covered person unless primarily reside country concern are employed contractor country concern covered person are designated department covered person order rule make clear definition covered person follows risk not race nationality ethnicity order rule are directed persons any race nationality ethnicity who are subject ownership direction jurisdiction control country concern definition covered person categorically includes any foreign person primarily resident country concern regardless their nationality race rule does not categorically treat country concern nationals are located third countries i.e not located united states not primarily resident country concern covered persons instead rule treats only subset country concern nationals third countries categorically covered persons those working for government country concern for entity covered person similarly department's authority designate specific individual covered person turns determination individual subject control jurisdiction direction country concern acting behalf purporting act behalf country concern covered person has knowingly caused directed violation rule definition u.s person also not dependent person's nationality race includes for example any person united states any u.s citizen lawful permanent resident any person who has been granted asylum refugee status united states for example under rule country concern citizen located united states u.s person unless individually designated result u.s person any race nationality ethnicity would not categorically treated covered person only circumstance which u.s person would treated covered person individual designation consequently rule adopts approach described nprm without change.\186 186 86150 page 1691 one commenter asked for clarification when foreign company united states with respect definition u.s person sec 202.256 more specifically commenter asked whether company conducts business with u.s individuals but does not have u.s branch subsidiary could meet definition selling u.s customers does not place foreign person united states foreign company with headquarters subsidiary other physical presence united states not united states for purposes sec 202.256 one commenter asserted proposed rule's definitions covered person person foreign person u.s person are internally inconsistent because proposed rule treats chinese russian citizens located united states u.s persons but treats u.s branches companies organized under laws country concern foreign persons commenter asked department ensure definitions align treat entities individuals alike department modify definitions demonstrate how entities individuals are treated differently proposed rule does not treat entities individuals differently rather treats branches companies which are not independent entities not have their own separate corporate personhood part their parent companies result demonstrated examples sec sec 202.256(b)(7 u.s branch company organized under laws country concern treated foreign person but u.s subsidiary foreign company which separate entity from parent treated u.s person this treatment foreign branches aligns with ofac's treatment foreign branches its ieepa-based sanctions programs department has added related examples sec sec 202.211(b)(7 further illustrate this point one commenter listed several fact patterns involving u.s person entities were owned percent more covered persons countries concern noted these u.s person entities would covered persons under rule described anprm including its example anyone united states including those temporarily united states would considered u.s person u.s persons including those temporarily united states would categorically treated covered persons.\187 see also example sec 202.211(b)(6 furthermore categories covered persons sec sec 202.211(a)(1 through explicitly apply only foreign persons not u.s persons category sec 202.211(a)(5 which applies any person requires individual designation department rule does not treat any u.s person including u.s subsidiary covered person covered person unless department has individually designated u.s person covered person rule adopts nprm's examples illustrating differences treatment between u.s subsidiary its foreign owner well between u.s companies their foreign branches rule adopts this proposal unchanged from nprm 187 15790-91 same commenter also provided several scenarios involving entities commenter concluded would meet covered person criteria sec sec 202.211(a)(2 these examples commenter repeated essentially same fact pattern country concern owns percent third-country company turn owns percent second third-country company some instances commenter stated company would covered person under rule because country concern's mere percent indirect ownership this reasoning misapplies 50-percent rule company covered person but not because country concern indirectly owns percent company twenty-five percent ownership country concern covered person less than 50-percent rule requires instead company covered person because percent more owned covered person company company covered person because percent more owned country concern however company were not covered person because its country concern ownership was less than percent did not meet any other criteria for covered persons then company would not covered person even with its less-than-50-percent indirect ownership country concern department has added example sec 202.211(b)(8 further clarify this point commenter recited several additional scenarios can reduced same fact pattern described above each referring subsidiaries located different countries are not countries concern commenter's examples mention various non-country concern locations where countries concern covered persons may have set subsidiaries asserts existence these subsidiaries somehow makes rule overbroad commenter appears claiming rule targets country concern covered person should regulate only persons property within country's territory any other result evidence rule's overbreadth department disagrees not aware any precedent for such claim fact pattern discussed above examples rule are classic demonstrations 50-percent rule being applied intended commenter does not explain how application percent rule which drafted match longstanding language application used ofac for years somehow produces unexpected overbroad result sanctions context for example ofac designates blocks russian bank operates russia owned russian government all property interests property russian bank are also blocked operation law russian bank operates subsidiaries countries outside russia even countries are partners allies united states those subsidiaries would blocked persons operation law u.s persons would prohibited from engaging transactions dealings with those subsidiaries wherever located unless exempt otherwise authorized commenter provides justification argument explaining why consistent application 50-percent rule across regulatory programs would inappropriate context this rule addition cross-border nature countries concern covered persons corporate hierarchy further supports need for rule regulate covered persons are outside country concern specifically national security foreign policy risks identified order exist with respect any entity subject ownership direction jurisdiction control country concern due fact each countries concern listed rule have

such rule adopts approach described nprm without change finally one commenter suggested department exempt from prohibitions rule any covered persons who are ethical compliant prevent undue

provided for attorney general publicly designate person whether individual entity covered person with whom u.s persons may not knowingly engage prohibited transaction restricted transaction fails comply with requirements subpart except otherwise authorized under rule set out nprm this process modeled generally processes for designation under various sanctions lists maintained ofac department received only limited comments this subject adopts proposed regulation without change one commenter suggested criteria for designation covered person were insufficiently determinate u.s persons would avoid legitimate transactions for fear their counterparties might designated some point future department believes this concern too speculative support change designation criteria which themselves reflect criteria established president order although resource information constraints other factors will require department exercise degree discretion choosing which potentially designable persons should pursued for designation whether person subject designation reasonably determinate once relevant facts are known context analogous sanctions regimes u.s companies routinely perform due diligence prospective counterparties u.s persons may lack access same information department has assessing their potential counterparties risk for designation unavoidable does not warrant changing criteria moreover sec 202.901 establishes process for seeking advisory opinion from department contemplated transactions same commenter suggested rule exempt from designation u.s.-based subsidiaries adopt cisa security requirements u.s.-based subsidiaries have substantial presence united states this commenter well another page 1693 commenter also observed entities--such u.s subsidiaries covered person-owned companies--may unable take actions avoid designation department rejects these suggestions explained nprm designation process allows department address risks national security may arise from designated person's relationship--whether voluntary involuntary--with country concern.\192 general matter national security risk from concluding covered data transaction with such person may arise from potential actions government country concern relation person not necessarily from intent personal characteristics individual entity scope subsidiary's business united states its adoption security measures may relevant exercise department's discretion designate subsidiary but will not categorically exempt subsidiary from designation under final rule entity whose relationship with covered person country concern changes--for example through divestment covered person owner--such entity would longer subject ownership control covered person otherwise satisfy designation criteria would able seek removal from covered persons list 192 86151 two commenters raised identical concerns designations would not subject independent judicial review designated person entity can petition department directly for reconsideration its designation department also anticipates designated entities will able avail themselves existing judicial remedies including applicable under administrative procedure act u.s.c 701 seq these commenters also objected consultation department with other agencies when making designation decisions was not mandatory commenters not explain how mandatory consultation every instance would meaningfully improve rule department believes mandatory consultation would unduly hinder administration rule slowing decision-making needlessly diverting other agencies resources from their primary missions for example may unnecessary consult with department health human services when contemplating designation entity works financial sector department does expect consult department state foreign policy concerns other agencies appropriate based their applicable equities expertise final rule better reflects this intention explicitly including department state list agencies consulted these commenters also objected use classified information designation decisions however use classified information expressly contemplated ieepa see u.s.c 1702(c courts have routinely upheld use

raised concerns designation process would violate due process some circumstances although department believes due process concerns are best addressed context specific case confident process outlined which largely mirrors process used ofac for designating sanctions targets--is consistent with constitution due process principles due process flexible concept constitution's preference for pre-deprivation notice opportunity heard subject many exceptions including when here pre-deprivation notice hearing would risk very harm public interest government seeks limit see e.g gilbert homar

customer kyc due diligence are generally already high unclear requirements will add business costs frustration commenter stated some information such entity's residence country incorporation may easy obtain but extent which entity subject influence control country concern covered person may not readily apparent again department cannot address this commenter's concerns because commenter did not provide any specific information justification for why proposed rule's kyc requirements are unclear however explained nprm proposed rule does not require u.s persons determine whether entity

persons u.s businesses need only rely published covered persons list when conducting due diligence another commenter asserted proposed rule's due diligence reporting auditing requirements would impose substantial administrative burden recommended department view due diligence requirements proportion degree risk associated with covered data transaction for example commenter suggested due diligence

commenter echoed view companies should able leverage existing privacy data security programs department strongly agrees nothing rule requires companies set new compliance programs where already have such programs otherwise meet requirements rule department expects many companies will adapt their existing compliance programs respond rule's requirements one commenter asserted without support proposed rule's due diligence requirements are akin requiring post offices read mail u.s citizens produce reports law enforcement what have read commenter questioned whether proposed rule conforms with u.s constitution described due diligence reporting requirements surveillance mandate asserted rule contains serious civil rights concerns flagged nprm docket did not reflect input from entities like department state's bureau democracy human rights american civil liberties union freedom house this comment distorted mischaracterized rule conclusory ways without any specificity analysis rule

offices other executive branch entities second rule exempts from its coverage expressive information informational materials personal communications among other things consistent with first amendment discussed part iv.d.1 this preamble third rule's due diligence reporting requirements are tailored ensure compliance help inform department's administration program rule affirmatively requires due diligence annual audits only for u.s persons engaging restricted transactions due diligence requirements are similar elements companies compliance programs sanctions compliance export controls contexts although contrast sanctions which impose strict liability for violations rule's prohibitions include knowledge standard see sec 202.1002 rule requires reports only for certain subset restricted transactions raise heightened risks where u.s entities receive reject offers engage prohibited transaction involving data brokerage help inform department about entities engaging data brokerage may seeking page 1697 undermine violate rules see sec 202.1104 much rule's recordkeeping requirements are line with documents businesses already keep such access logs other than breezily using buzzwords surveillance mandate mischaracterize rule's compliance requirements commenter did not describe what civil rights constitutional concerns proposed rule raises american civil liberties union provided comment proposed rule did not raise concerns asserted commenter although all members public had opportunity comment anprm nprm freedom house did not submit comment commenter's buzzwords unsupported accusations have basis rule itself provide reason alter rule section 202.1002--audits for restricted transactions nprm proposed imposing annual audit requirement condition engaging restricted transaction verify improve compliance with security requirements section 202.1002(f nprm proposed requiring auditor submit written report describes audit methodology including policies other documents reviewed personnel interviewed any facilities equipment networks systems examined 199 199 86224 one commenter requested department change this provision insert terms relevant before terms policies personnel facilities ensure auditors not randomly review all documents personnel equipment relevant parties this comment appears misinterpret audit section proposed rule reading sec 202.1002(f isolation from sec 202.1002's other provisions section 202.1002(e proposed rule defined scope audit was already limited focus only activities covered proposed rule contrast sec 202.1002(f addressed only what auditor must include audit report.\200 does not require auditor review all companies policies interview all its personnel examine all its facilities equipment networks systems however ensure regulatory text clear final rule adds term relevant sec 202.1002(f)(2)(ii clarify audit report must describe only relevant policies personnel interviewed facilities equipment networks systems examined auditor 200 couple commenters expressed concerns proposed rule did not include protections for confidentiality trade secrets contained reports audits from either public disclosure evidentiary use unclear why commenter thinks department would not use audit report evidentiary support for enforcement action report demonstrates company's failure comply with rule audit report one ways department seeks impose broad compliance with rule for confidentiality department would bound existing legal requirements regarding protection confidential proprietary information.\201 201 see e.g cfr 16.7 number commenters requested companies allowed use audits completed for other purposes comply with final rule avoid imposing significant compliance burdens companies department agrees with these comments notes proposed rule required company conduct audit its compliance with proposed rule but did not require company conduct separate audit comply with audit requirements final rule does not include requirement either however audit must specifically sufficiently expressly address requirements set forth rule multiple commenters requested companies allowed use internal auditors audit compliance with rule reduce their compliance burden for restricted transaction department's extensive experience with corporate compliance national security criminal other contexts internal audits often lack independence expertise resources conduct objective thorough evaluations their own company's compliance efforts while external audits often provide more effective comprehensive assessments however department recognizes with appropriate independence expertise resources internal audits may also effective may sensible part compliance program depending u.s company's individualized risk profile department has thus updated rule delete requirement audits external allow internal audits are otherwise sufficiently independent department intends provide additional guidance requirements for sufficiently independent audit after final rule published one commenter suggested department adopt self certification system akin data privacy framework department allow for third-party reviews condition for engaging restricted transactions although department appreciates value certifications privacy regimes such data privacy framework does not find self-certifications sufficient ensure compliance given national security risks government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data rule seeks address audit provisions set forth sec 202.1002 are tailored ensure compliance with rule including security requirements ensure auditors have requisite independence effectively assess compliance one commenter claimed audit requirement proposed rule unnecessarily broad because would apply all data transactions straying beyond national security concerns behind proposed rule imposing challenging requirements u.s companies commenter suggested department consider risk-based approach auditing takes into account sensitivity data nature transactions counterparties rather than imposing uniform annual auditing cadence for all restricted transactions few commenters also stated annual auditing requirement was burdensome one commenter suggested companies allowed conduct random spot audits department require audits for companies engaged high volumes restricted transactions another commenter suggested companies only required conduct audits after determining are not compliance with rule audit requirement proposed rule explicitly applies only u.s persons engaging restricted transactions does not apply broadly all u.s persons engaging data transactions change necessary clarify this point however department appreciates scope audit provision nprm's proposed sec 202.1002(e)(1 could read apply all data transactions even those outside scope rule has revised terminology sec 202.1002(e)(1 final rule clarify scope audit must examine u.s person's restricted transactions not all their data transactions has revised page 1698 sec 202.1002(f)(2 clarify audit report need only address nature u.s person's restricted transactions department expects auditor would need review u.s entity's procedures for determining whether transactions are restricted prohibited exempt ensure entity appropriately identifying handling restricted transactions once auditing requirement triggered rule would require auditor examine data transactions engaged u.s person has identified restricted transactions determine whether data transactions satisfy cisa security requirements other compliance obligations proposed rule already took into account sensitivity nature transactions counterparties limiting scope proposed rule's restrictions countries concern covered persons including bulk thresholds trigger rule's requirements department believes annual audits are necessary for u.s persons stay current with their data transactions security measures put place protect data spot audits would provide only snapshot time would not provide company guidance about adequate remedial measures must take come into compliance with rule although one commenter noted agencies monitoring cfius mitigation agreements often not require annual audits commenter does not appear consider cfius mitigation agreements may contain other reporting obligations can apprise cfius monitoring agencies potentially regular basis about company's compliance with cfius mitigation without need for annual audit rule does not contain comparable reporting obligations furthermore without auditing unclear how u.s entity would adequately determine whether compliance with rule for these reasons department makes changes this issue subpart k--reporting recordkeeping requirements section 202.1101--records recordkeeping requirements nprm proposed requiring any u.s person engaging restricted transaction keep full accurate records each restricted transaction keep these records available for examination for least years after date each transaction length statute limitations for violations ieepa proposed rule described required records detail which include written policy describing compliance program written policy documenting implementation security measures for restricted transactions results any audits evaluate compliance with security measures documentation due diligence conducted verify data flow involved any restricted transaction other pertinent information regarding each transaction one commenter repeated their claim from anprm this provision amounts real-time u.s law enforcement-directed monitoring data transmissions private citizens companies this comment has basis rule nprm explained nothing rule its face practice requires u.s companies surveil their employees customers other private entities all sec 202.1101 does require u.s persons engage restricted transactions have implement risk-based compliance program common feature sanctions export controls anti-money laundering privacy host national security other laws eu's gdpr for example requires every data controller maintain record processing activities under its responsibility including

stat 6-1-1302(c 6-1-1309 colo code reg 904-3 part conn gen stat 42-522 unclear why commenter believes similarly requiring u.s persons monitor their own transactions their own compliance with this rule use audit double-check their compliance identify areas non-compliance equates surreptitious law enforcement surveillance dragnet rule has nothing with united states government's authorities lawfully engage law enforcement national security activities gather intelligence personal communications expressive information metadata ordinarily associated with expressive materials reasonably necessary enable transmission dissemination expressive materials are specifically excluded from scope rule rule does not regulate purely domestic transactions between u.s persons like collection maintenance processing use data u.s persons within united states unless one those persons publicly designated covered person nor recordkeeping reporting other requirements rule amount mechanism for federal government obtain access underlying data u.s persons nothing rule requires regulated parties submit underlying sensitive personal data federal government for example annual reporting requirement sec 202.1103 for certain restricted transactions requirement sec 202.1104 report certain rejected transactions require only top-level description covered data transaction such types volumes data involved transaction method data transfer department expects page 1699 u.s persons will fulfill these requirements including only generalized statements report such 15,000 u.s persons human genomic data transferred file transfer protocol without providing any underlying data sure there may limited circumstances which department may need greater details about underlying sensitive personal data such company seeks advisory opinion about whether certain kind data meets one definitions for category sensitive personal data u.s person applies for specific license adjudicating license requires more details about kinds data are subject transaction company's non-compliance with rule any enforcement action turns dispute over data itself but department's experience even those limited circumstances should ordinarily resolvable without needing access underlying data itself--such through asking questions about nature data parties similar what occurs other national-security processes such cfius committee for assessment foreign participation united states telecommunications services sector several commenters suggested department include rules protect companies confidential information proprietary information trade secrets ensure such information will not publicly disclosed used for evidentiary purposes change was made response this comment these kinds protections are already enshrined other longstanding laws such freedom information act trade secrets act rule will comply with them extent apply creating additional restrictions disclosure use such information unnecessary could undermine department's ability investigate potential violations rule enforce another commenter observed many u.s companies not transact data but rather their data movement part system workflow according commenter rule's recordkeeping requirements presume companies have identified isolated all discrete restricted transactions but far more burdensome when data are part globally integrated workflows described example which engineer company responsible for product development de-bugging may have routine access user data claim those workflows make more practical cost-effective more broadly adopt requisite security requirements than apply them piecemeal fashion department appreciates this rule will result some compliance costs but change appears necessary address this comment recordkeeping requirements not presume u.s persons engage only discretely identified restricted transactions indeed comment's suggested approach its own example appears workable solution based limited facts provided depending specific circumstances company may how some companies decide reasonably comply with these regulations section 202.1102--reports furnished demand proposed rule included provisions assist department investigating potential noncompliance with rule these provisions include requiring any u.s person furnish under oath from time time any time may required attorney general complete information relative any covered data transaction subject prohibition restriction one commenter stated sec 202.1102 means for u.s companies disclose produce information upon demand law enforcement authorities change was made response this comment section 202.1102 merely states statutory recordkeeping subpoena authority granted president delegated department under order different than other ieepa recordkeeping subpoena authority implemented department treasury across its sanctions programs department commerce under executive orders 13873 14034 this same commenter also asserts requirements sec 202.1102 would impose significant budgetary expenses united states government which would tasked with reviewing information what commenter asserted without support are billions low risk transmissions millions low-risk transactions this comment merely repeated this commenter's claim restricted transactions are low risk which has been addressed separately part iv.c.1 this preamble comment provided specific analysis number non-exempt covered data transactions are subject restrictions this rule expenses commenter believes are required implement rule nothing rule establishes program requires department review approve data transmissions transactions advance contrary hallmark risk-based compliance private sector which best positioned know its own transactions responsible for managing its own compliance without need for advance united states government review approval every individual transaction undertaken similar approaches used for sanctions export controls while rule does allow department ask for records institutes discrete reporting requirements for rejected transactions for certain high-risk entities annual basis does not mandate all such records produced for department department declines make any changes rule based this comment same commenter expressed concern reporting provisions set out subpart could require some regulated entities such electronic communications services providers subject restrictions u.s.c 2701 seq report information about transactions with their customers federal law may otherwise prohibit absence specified legal process department does not take position regarding commenter's legal analysis however department does not intend for regulated entities construe reporting provisions set forth subpart impose reporting requirements inconsistent with federal law department has revised provisions subpart clarify reporting requirements not oblige parties furnish information reports federal law would otherwise prohibit another commenter pharmaceutical research field argued their current auditing recordkeeping measures already adhere much what required under nprm asserted would unduly burdensome for them repeat these efforts nothing rule requires u.s persons unnecessarily duplicate their records create redundant systems u.s persons can use existing auditing recordkeeping other compliance practices systems extent fully satisfy requirements this rule section 202.1104--reports rejected prohibited transactions nprm proposed requiring any u.s person has received affirmatively rejected offer from page 1700 another person engage prohibited transaction must submit report department within business days rejecting one commenter noted 14-day period for reporting rejected transactions should extended minimum days commenter argued days was too narrow from compliance standpoint days would allow companies sufficient time investigate document confirm relevant details about rejected transaction department declines adopt this suggested change while department appreciates desire for longer reporting period proposed 14-day period consistent with indeed longer than similar reporting period implemented ofac which requires reporting rejected transactions within business days rejecting such transaction.\207 these reports will help department identify instances which potential countries concern covered persons seek enter into prohibited transactions with u.s persons contravention rule including through evasion information submitted these reports will thus assist department monitoring u.s persons compliance with rule identifying matters for potential investigation undertaking enforcement actions identifying ways which refine rule future additionally timely reporting rejected transaction could real time potentially curtail adversaries future attempts access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data because department can promptly uncover conspiracies evade avoid rule's prohibitions identify shell companies agents investigate targets for designation enforcement actions mitigate potentially ongoing threats u.s national security which increase longer rejected restricted transaction goes unreported furthermore lengthening deadline unnecessary allow investigation documentation because sec 202.1104(c already limits reports rejected transactions required information extent known available person filing report time transaction rejected department thus expects u.s persons will generally satisfy this reporting requirement filing initial report with information known time transaction rejected supplementing later with additional documentation relevant details from results their investigations requested department department thus declines change timeframe 207 cfr 501.604(c subpart m--penalties finding violation nprm proposed civil criminal penalties including process for imposing civil monetary penalties similar those used other ieepa-based regimes one commenter requested reduced criminal penalties noting penalties years prison seem quite punitive for covered data transaction violation department declines take approach would create inconsistency with other penalties imposed for ieepa-based criminal violations under ieepa criminal penalties apply any person convicted willfully committing willfully attempting commit willfully conspiring commit aiding abetting commission violation any license order regulation prohibition issued under ieepa penalties stated nprm are commensurate with willful actions person whom department imposes such penalties department further notes these penalties are intentionally designed severe reflecting gravity national security risks associated with violating rule its provisions are intended deter prevent violations prohibitions finally provisions ieepa allow department exercise its discretion upon conviction criminal violators may fined not more than 1,000,000 natural person may imprisoned for not more than years both with all federal criminal cases unless criminal penalty has mandatory minimum sentence which rule does not ultimate penalty statutory maximum will imposed federal district judge who will determine any sentence after considering u.s sentencing guidelines other statutory factors another commenter recommended entity compliance with rule makes voluntary self-disclosure vsd

distinguish padfaa from proposed rule but contended proposed rule redundant light padfaa urged department incorporate provisions into final rule clarify which agency would take primary jurisdiction over activities violate both padfaa this final rule another commenter urged department coordinate with ftc enforcement activities because ftc lacks experience addressing national security concerns not appropriate agency identify determine whether entity controlled foreign adversary another commenter requested department sign memorandum understanding with ftc ensure cooperation department discussed nprm department does not believe would appropriate alter proposed rule's scope light padfaa for several reasons.\210 there page 1701 are significant differences scope between padfaa proposed rule which department set forth some detail nprm which commenters not address although department declines set forth which agency would take primary jurisdiction over enforcement actions department explained nprm department ftc intend coordinate closely ensure these authorities are exercised harmonized way minimize any conflicting obligations duplicative enforcement.\211 for example department ftc intend coordinate appropriate licensing decisions any potential enforcement actions under padfaa with respect activities may authorized exempt licensed under rule 210 86155 211 for related reasons department rejects one commenter's suggestion department abandon rulemaking because enactment padfaa makes president's declaration emergency unnecessary legal matter president's declaration emergency unreviewable court not decision department authorized revisit substantively rule covers range transactions--such restricted transactions--that present national security threats recognized president's declaration order are entirely outside padfaa's scope this suggestion also ignores significant differences scope structure between order padfaa which nprm discussed another commenter renewed suggestion originally raised comment anprm department address additional potential overlap between proposed rule icts program its rules relevant sensitive data bis nprm regarding requirements for

states government's own activities including operation its own devices made clear section order this limitation would preclude department from requiring uoom united states government devices operating system level commenter suggested however department has shared this recommendation with cisa others within united states government are focused securing sensitive personal data united states government's own systems devices one commenter agree[d there needs regulation including greater extent u.s data but noted rule falls short effective law another commenter noted light glaring need for national data protection against threats from abroad recent data breaches this rule may not far enough but least serves set foundation for much needed wall against continued foreign threats while department appreciates concept raised these commenters order only authorizes department promulgate regulations prohibit otherwise restrict transactions present unacceptable risk national security affording countries concern covered persons with access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data department has publicly explained this rule one key part broader solution make more difficult for countries concern obtain americans sensitive personal data while this rule focused one set risk vectors access through commercial activities other risk vectors such theft computer intrusions must necessarily addressed other complementary national security cybersecurity privacy measures regulatory requirements department designated proposed rule significant under executive order

department has prepared fria potential economic impacts this rule placed fria this rule's docket regulations.gov docket nsd-104 fria evaluates potential economic impacts this final rule entities united states are likely affected rule department requested comments initial regulatory impact analysis iria including economic impact proposed rule department received several comments directed iria summary response those comments are contained full fria found regulations.gov department estimates discounted annualized cost regulation approximately 459 million annually extremely high potential net benefits i.e expected benefits less estimated costs justify moving forward with rule approximately 459 million estimated annual cost would significantly protect u.s national security including well over 100 million american individuals who are potential targets adversaries exploiting government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data while benefits national security are difficult quantify department expects them substantial including preventing use data countries concern covered persons micro-target u.s persons aggregate insights from large datasets target united states government private-sector activities enhance military capabilities include facilitating development bioweapons meanwhile estimated annual cost regulation very low relative relevant economic activity for example approximately 459 million estimated annual cost rule only about one-third page 1703 percent 0.3 percent 176 billion revenues generated u.s computing infrastructure data processing services web hosting services industry sector department therefore expects national security foreign policy benefits while qualitative will far outweigh estimated costs final rule although fria notes monetary value data sold countries concern appears represent relatively small percentage overall value all such transactions from u.s entities data sold--especially when government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data--presents significant risks u.s persons u.s national security explained more fully part this preamble countries concern seek obtain government related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data for malicious uses undermine national security foreign policy united states overall department estimates this rule may directly financially impact approximately 3,000 companies engaged data brokerage additional 1,500 firms currently engage restricted transactions involving government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data with covered persons this relatively small fraction overall number u.s firms engaged transactions involving bulk data rule only affects those specific types commercial transactions identified rule involve access government-related data bulk u.s sensitive personal data six identified countries concern covered persons these annual costs may include forgone transactions cost deploying cisa security requirements for restricted transactions direct costs compliance many compliance costs regulated entities will incur due rule are one-time costs such initial assessments remediation efforts will needed only once come into initial compliance with rule's requirements other costs such monitoring compliance audits reporting training will occur annually fria explains department cannot assess whether any secondary impacts indirect costs this rule are reasonably likely given limitations available information resulting uncertainty qualifications surrounding analysis such impacts costs are still too speculative hypothetical quantified this analysis even assuming however such impacts costs were reasonably likely could reasonably estimated department would still conclude high qualitative quantitative benefits national security foreign policy this rule would outweigh estimated impacts costs additionally rule includes exemptions allow notable categories commercial transactions continue unimpeded rule's prohibitions restrictions reduce overall costs rule see sec sec 202.501 through 202.511 sections 202.800 through 202.803 further provide mechanism for entities obtain licenses for otherwise restricted prohibited transactions finally fria identifies both baseline for department's cost estimates potential impact rule well assumptions used determine potential impact these assumptions include estimates number potentially impacted parties costs compliance number potentially affected transactions these assumptions are necessary because new regulatory program there little data publicly available about markets impacted this rule assumptions are also over-inclusive terms impact estimates because rely north american industry classification system naics codes include entities likely not impacted rule well transactions will exempted from rule's prohibitions restrictions nonetheless assumptions provide best estimate both estimated costs expected benefits rule given available economic information fria also includes updated dollar amounts for various estimated impacts most notably for estimated total annual costs compliance for this rule well 10-year annualized cost estimates new figures are lower though not significantly than those projected iria included nprm changes not reflect substantially new data analyses but rather provide greater accuracy tables correcting for previous rounding errors unifying

relevant industries can considered small entities rule impacts substantial number small entities table v-1--small business size standard affected firms share affected number affected firms firms are number affected small small firms 4,500 approximately approximately percent 4,050 this analysis assumes small entities affected rule will incur compliance costs around 32,380 per firm per year compared with annual compliance cost 400,460 for largest affected firms costs percentage annual revenue will vary company company department not aware recent reliable revenue data firm size for data broker industry but reasonable assumption firm's revenues from data sales are not sufficient cover compliance costs then firm will have incentive exit market furthermore calculating proportion costs associated with rule falls small firms complicated fact several rule's provisions--specifically requirements related cybersecurity due diligence recordkeeping reporting--likely involve high fixed costs even small entities have less complex business operations leading fewer complications related compliance will still face higher cost burden proportionally from rule than larger firms large entities will likely already have greater portion fixed costs associated with rule covered existing capabilities therefore while costs associated with security due diligence requirements will smaller absolute terms for smaller entities such entities will likely need pay higher proportion their overall budgets comply due unknowns large number small entities possible substantial number small firms will experience significant impact description projected reporting recordkeeping other compliance requirements rule rule requires firms engaged restricted transactions adhere certain standards for
